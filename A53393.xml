            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat the Doctrine here in this Treatiſe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, is not unneceſſary, will be eaſily concluded by all thoſe that are any way concerned in the intereſt and honour of the bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt; when they conſider how baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is abuſed, villanouſly handled, and cruelly mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; what wounds and bruiſes, what mutibations, and even decollations, and that in the houſe of his friends, ſuch at leaſt, as pretend themſelves Chriſtians, he hath received: we have no comfort donbtleſs but by Chriſt; nor by Chriſt unleſs it be by whole Chriſt, ſound Chriſt: Chriſt divided, maimed, or mutilated, can do us no good: <hi>A bone of him muſt not be broken:</hi> nor may an atomical fragment of him be loſt. And yet if we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, we may find ſome, not only breaking his bones, or tearing him piece meal one joint from another, but even breaking his heart, by rending his Godhead from his manhood, or nulli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ying one joint, one part, one excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, one attribute or other, that eſſentially belonged to one of theſe. Of old ſome there were who deſpoiled him of his body: others indeed allowed him a body, but a body brought from heaven, made of caeleſtial matter: others but a body framed out of the Elements, not a humane body, or a body partaking any thing of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mother. Some contended his body was meerly a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm,
<pb facs="tcp:39302:3"/>without any reality at all: a deluſive apparition. We may not forget the <hi>Mono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>helites,</hi> that would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, as man, any Will; nor yet paſs over the <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts,</hi> who though they allowed him a body, denied ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, that he had any Soul. The <hi>Neſtorians</hi> divided him into two diſtinct perſons each perfectly compleat, ſubſiſting in themſelves apart, a God, and a man, without any perſonal union of the Natures: ſo making us indeed two Chriſts (are we not beholding to them?) inſtead of one; though indeed making us more than one, they left us none at all. But then came <hi>Eutiches,</hi> and he takes away both Godhead and manhood at once, in a ſort: for while he confuſedly jumbles both Natures together, he makes him neither God nor man perfectly, but ſome third thing, though what, they know not, nor any man elſe, unleſs it were a confuſed Chaos; nor fleſh nor fiſh, nor good Red Herring.</p>

            <p>But I muſt not forget the <hi>Arians:</hi> they ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to deal a little better with him; for as they never denied him to be ſomething; firſt a man, ſo they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg him too to be God indeed; but then 'twas but a dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied God, a God by grace and purchaſe, not by nature and eſſence; that is, a God, and no God. A Sacrilegiſt, one that being but a creature in himſelf, was ſo bold, as to challenge not the name and title only, but the honour, eſſence, and incommunicable attributes of the ſupream Godhead. I need name no more, this is enough to ſhew, how well they uſed him of old.</p>
            <p>But how is he uſed now? why truly (which could ſcarce be thought of) altogether as bad: Christ hath ſtill enemies, and ſeveral armies of them that march up to confront him. The firſt are the <hi>Socinians,</hi> theſe lead the van, requiring him to lay by his Godhead, and in
<pb facs="tcp:39302:3"/>effecth is Prieſthood too. This is a blow to the head. Then came the Familiſts, the ſpawn of <hi>Henry Nicholas,</hi> who think to puff him off into meer fume and ſmoke, as a meer Allegory; theſe lay their ax to the root of the tree, and endeavour to deſtroy him root and branch at once, making him ſcarce any better than a meer nothing. The <hi>Antinomians</hi> come next, and theſe deal worſe with him than the former: for while they ſay, He impoſeth no Laws, leaving his Proſelytes to be lawleſs and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious libertines, they make him to be a wicked thing (God, man, or devil, no matter which); a wicked thing, which ever it be) is worſe than nothing: this is a deadly thruſt too. A fourth ſort follows, I know not what to call them, <hi>Novaliſts, Enthuſiaſts,</hi> or <hi>Quakers;</hi> I know not which term to give them, or whether they may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all theſe: Theſe, as I ſaid follow: for from the wild heterodoxes of the former they have with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of rudeneſs, impudence, ignorance, and non-ſenſe, patcht up a ſomething or a nothing, — from or with the <hi>Socinians</hi> they account him but a meer man, at leaſt ſome calling him, The man that ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> and with the <hi>Nicholaitans</hi> they account him but a Quality, an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> a meer illuſion, a light within them, which is not much better than an Allegory, or rather worſe; and with the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> they reſpect no laws of King or Keiſar, nor Chriſt neither in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but the dictates of their own fanatick brains: is not this worſe than what <hi>Pilate</hi> abhorred, <hi>Shall I cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your King?</hi> it is a crucifying or worſe, even a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilating, an annihilating of our King, our Chriſt, our God. For the Popeling, I need not ſay any thing, it hath been often enough proved to them, That by their prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bleſſed Virgin before him, as to their Addreſſes to her more than unto him, her compaſſion and comfort
<pb facs="tcp:39302:4"/>which they ſuppoſe ſhe affords them more than He: while they worſhip the Picture with the ſame worſhip they do the divine perſon, with many other particulars; they ungod him, and bring him into the condition of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, while they make a creature equal, if not ſuperior to him in any excellency or perfection; their magnifying his body into an immenſity ſometimes; and then again at the ſame time minifying him into the ſmalleſt atomes of a wafer cake, they nullifie his manhood. As for his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office, their diſpenſing with his, and ordaining others, contrary to his Laws; their abrogating his Doctrines, and ſubſtituting new and contrary; their offering up a wafer cake for the expiating the ſins both of quick and dead, take away all his offices. But it is the Demonolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts I am ſet againſt now in ſpecial; who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their pretences to the contrary, abuſe Chriſt as much as any of the reſt; for while they equalize the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, yea even Witches with him, for ſtupendious and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous operations, they cut off his head, or ungod him, and what can be worſe? He that debaſeth a King unto the low degree of a common plebeian, exalting the plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to an equality of power with the King, maketh a King no King, but a meer pleibeian; and the plebeians no plebeians any longer, but ſo many Kings: ſo they that equalize devils with Chriſt for power, make Chriſt either no King for power, or at leaſt devils for power Kings equal to Chriſt. This is not a bruiſing of his heel only, which is as much as the devil is ſaid to do; but a breaking of his head, nay a cruſhing of his heel, head, heart, members, body, and all into atomes: are not theſe cruel handlings, and manglings uſed againſt Chriſt? Sure the Godhead, as in all other Excellencies, ſo in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt have the preheminence, and be paramount, or elſe his power will not anſwer his other Excellencies (he
<pb facs="tcp:39302:4"/>ſhould be lame on that ſide) nor befit the Godhead. But upon the ſuppoſitions of the Demonologiſts, the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion may be juſtly put, Who the greater Miracler, Chriſt or Belial, Jeſus or Beelzebub? and if equal Miracles, equal Gods, nay doubtleſs and he the greater God, who is the greater Miracler; which yet it ſeems may fall to the devils ſhare, and ſo the devil the only God, Chriſt none: for his power being gone, or but equalized, much more if exceeded his Godhead is gone doubtleſs. This is not bruiſing his heel, nor breaking his head, but a running him quite thorow, bowels, brain, heart and all. I know they dreſs him a poor, paltry, cold pultiſe of marks, and intentions, and aims, — but it doth not ſo much as cool, or cover, much leſs cure the wound, and thus they leave him. Is not this hard uſage? and yet when by their comments they ſubject him ſo to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils inſolency, as that he is content it ſeems with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and puſillanimity, or cowardice enough, to be kicks and ſpurned from poſt to pillar, from prow to poop, like a football, (though there be nothing imaginable to urge or to anſwer ſo great a debaſement) from deſart to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, from pinacle to peak, and from peak to deſart again; me ſeems they uſed him worſe yet: but I meddle not with this now; to the former only I propoſe my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant ſentiments in this Treatiſe; and is it not needful? for if his enemies be left alone, they will take away at laſt both name and memory; for what is left of him alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, when every of theſe have taken his bite, his morſel, more than was of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> the ſcull, the feet, the palms of the hands? If we will indeed have Chriſt any longer, 'tis fit we look after him, to preſerve what is left, and recover if poſſible what hath been ſnatcht off from him; 'tis high time to endeavour this eſpecially when the Chaplains and Champions of his grand enemy are ſo
<pb facs="tcp:39302:5"/>numerous, every Pamphleter almoſt giving a ſnap, or a ſnarl to him, but ſcarce one that ſo much as takes up a ſtone to caſt at theſe currs; or if any do, he ſhall be branded ſtraight for a Somatiſt, a Saduce, an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripturiſt, yea, an Atheiſt; but ſuch froth ſent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, returns upon the faces of them that vomit it. I ſhall ſay no more in vindication of the undertake, Here is a ſhort extract of what may be more largely expreſt hereafter conſider and judg, Chriſtian Reader; and if thou be a Reader truly Chriſtian, conclude thou wilt, That the opinion here maintained, is not unneceſſary, or unſeaſonable in theſe times.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39302:7"/>villany. In a word, it is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy from the chief fundamentals of Chriſtian Religion; which as it is the higheſt crime that can be committed, as being a deſerting, a renouncing, and as it were abjuring of theſe points, that are moſt neceſſary for the upholding of Gods Honour, and the comfort of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So it is attended, with the moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequents, irremiſſibility, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation inevitable, if perpetual. <hi>If we ſin wilfully, after we have received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin, but—Heb.</hi> 10.26.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39302:7"/>(and owning the Devil) would perſwade others to do the like? So that I think, though there be many other great crying ſins in the World, in this our World too, our Church and State, yet none greater, none ſo great as this; and therefore I may fitly, nay, muſt out of neceſſity (and woe unto me if I did not) ſet my ſelf, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, againſt this moſt deſperate, and moſt dangerous Heterodox.</p>

               <p>I Need not ſtop to prove that theſe are the latter times, as I ſaid, nor that in theſe latter times iniquity ſhall abound, nor that then deſperate Opinions, helliſh Doctrines, and damnable Hereſies will be broacht, abound, and be entertained. This is plain, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.30. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. But we need go no further than this preſent Text: <hi>The ſpirit ſpeaketh expreſly, that in the latter days ſome ſhall depart from the faith.</hi>—Apoſtacy, Apoſtacy from the Doctrine of Chriſt, to the Doctrine of Devils, will be rife in the latter days. <hi>Now the ſpirit ſpeaketh expreſly, That in the latter days, ſome ſhall depart from</hi>— This is it then that I pitch upon, That the belief, entertainment, or attention to the Doctrine of Devils, is the higheſt, groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, and moſt abominable Apoſtacy that ever was, or ſhall be: It is the Apoſtacy of the latter times. There is no darkneſs nor difficulty in the terms, plain and eaſie all to be underſtood. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, of Devils or Daymons, good or bad, Angels or Fiends. The worſhip of Angels is an Idolatrous Apoſtacy, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils is no better, but much worſe: And here <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Nor this Apoſtle, nor any of the reſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in all their Epiſtles, ever uſing this word diſtinctly for Angels, or comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, as including Angels or Devils; but for Devils ſtill diſtinctly, or bad Angels. The <hi>Helots</hi> were once Freemen of <hi>Laconia,</hi> but for ſome miſdemeanour loſt their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and were made Slaves. Will any Man now that hears of the <hi>Helots,</hi> think, That the Knights and Gentlemen of <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> are meant by that term? For though in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techreſtical ſenſe, the whole Nation of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> may be ſignified by that word, <hi>Helots,</hi> yea, the Gentlemen and Knights too poſſbly, to grant this alſo; yet that the <hi>Helots</hi> ſhould ſignifie the Gentlemen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively, in reſpect of thoſe Slaves, were very harſh: The term properly belonging to the Slaves, not to the Gentlemen of that Countrey. So when the Apoſtle tells us there will be ſtrange Doctrines concerning the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſignifying properly and generally, Devils rather than Angels)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39302:9"/>will any Man think that the Apoſtle means Angels excluſively in reſpect of Devils, and not Devils rather, or at leaſt Devils as well as Angels; and this taſt for my Opinion is enough. Beſides, it is here put in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe Angels, that lookt upon, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and adored Chriſt, as manifeſted in the Fleſh, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.16. The good Angels adore and admire him, for the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Myſteries and wonderful benefits that come in, of, by, or through his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and for the excellency of his power ſhewn in ſtupend operations, for the good, the exceeding great good of his Church, far above all that they could do, yea think or dream of. Thus was he preached to the Gentiles, believed on ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in the World, and for this, or thus, was he received deſervedly into the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Glory. But in the latter days ſome will be ſo far from holding this Truth, That they will give heed to ſuch Doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Devils that will make them as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable as Chriſt himſelf, equalizing them and him, if not preferring them before him, for power and mightineſs of operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as though theſe Devils deſerved to be Canonized as well, and exalted to the right Hand of the Majeſty on high. This may be the Paraphraſe.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:39302:10"/>
               <p>All the ſcruple is in the Grammar of the Text, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or any other prepoſition, The Doctrine of Devils. It is poſſible ſome may be (and yet it is a wonder any ſhould be) ſo ſtupid, as to think that doctrine of Devils intimates the doctrines preacht by Devils, They (the Devils) the Doctors, the Preachers and Promulgators of ſome Doctrines, and the audible Trumpeters of them: but this is a wild interpretation, for it ſuppoſeth, 1. That Devils are ſpeaking things, have the Inſtruments of Speech, can ſpeak diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and articulately what they will; and yet they are meer Spirits, immaterial and incorporeal Subſtances. <hi>A Spirit hath not Fleſh and Bones, as ye ſee me have, Luke</hi> 24.39. 2. They ſhould have the Pulpits and exerciſe there publickly; but How then ſhould we know whether we ever heard a true Miniſter of the Goſpel evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelizing it; or elſe fiends from Hell demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing ſtill. 3. This ſpeech of the Spirit, would not ſeem to be ſo true; but rather improbable and incredible, ſince in One Thouſand Six Hundred Years and more when we be come into the very laſt Times, we never hear of any ſuch thing in truth; nor can poſſibly conceive how it can be: but yet the doctrine of Demons hath been
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39302:10"/>rife, general and Catholick this thirteen or fourteen hundred years, and almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-where entertained. 4. One part of the Spirits caution here thus ſhould ſeem vain, frivolous and needleſs, though it be uſhered in with moſt grave, and in moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn terms: <hi>Now the ſpirit ſpeaketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly.</hi> And who after ſuch a preparation, or preamble, would not expect ſome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſtrange or unuſual things to follow, yea, ſome things that were inconceivable, or incredible without ſuch a Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation? And yet one part of this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Revelation ſhould be but this, That Devils would ſpeak lyes in hypocriſie, and have their Conſciences ſeared,—which is a thing no Man can doubt of; if Devils ſpeak, they'l ſpeak lyes, as being lyars and hypocrites from the beginning; and that their Conſciences are ſeared with an hot Iron, who can doubt, that conſiders what they are, Devils? 5. Forbidding to marry, commanding to abſtain from meats, are things we know that came in, not by the Pulpetting of Devils, (though poſſibly, or rather but poſſibly by their ſuggeſtion) but by or through mens ſuperſtition, and covetouſneſs. 6. One ſpecial means, and poſſibly the only means, That the Apoſtle propoſeth here for the prevention of this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39302:11"/>Doctrine of Devils, is, To <hi>Refuſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and old wives tales, verſ.</hi> 7. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, reject, and contemn thoſe, and ſuch Fables as thoſe, the fictions of Poets, the legends of Romances, and wild Dreams of Dotards. Without giving heed to ſuch things, Men had never been ſeduced into the credulity of this mad Doctrine, but attending to, and believing of ſuch wild conceits, it is almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but that they muſt be ſeduced into ſuch Heterodoxes. We have a notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this, in the ſecond of <hi>Nice,</hi> (by ſome called the ſeventh general Council) wherein, there were by ſome moſt Grand and Reverend Men (as they are counted) ſuch wild, mad, ſhameleſs, and incredible lyes reported; that a Man of any Witt, Reaſon, or but common ſenſe, would think the reporters moſt impudent Lyers, that they Vyed who ſhould invent the moſt ſhameleſs figments; and that they were mad and ſenſeleſs Ideots, that would, or could believe them: And yet by theſe moſt monſtrous fables, confirmed they that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry of Image-worſhip. See how much prophane and old Wives tales, the dreams, lyes, &amp; dotages of Men will prevail if heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened unto: And therefore was it a needful Caveat of the Apoſtle to preſcribe <hi>(Refuſing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39302:11"/>prophane, and old wives tales)</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of this wild Doctrine, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils. If it be well obſerved 'twill be found undeniably true, That the ground and riſe of this opinion, was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from ſuch Tales as the Council of <hi>Ancyra</hi> plainly declares. 7. The words, <hi>Prophane and old wives tales,</hi> ſeem to be ſet in oppoſition to theſe in the former verſe <hi>(words of faith and good doctrine):</hi> As alſo the hearkner to ſuch Tales, to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a good Miniſter of Chriſt, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed up in the words of Faith and good Doctrine; he muſt refuſe prophane and old Wives fables, and thus ſhall he be ſecure againſt this damnable Doctrine of Devils; and Apoſtacy from the fundamentals of Chriſtian Religion: Prophane and old Wives tales being the chief, if not only means of being ſeduced in this particular. 8. All the particulars of this Propheſie, are in our ſenſe evidently fulfilled already: <hi>E. G.</hi> Forbidding to marry, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to abſtain from meats, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits, and giving heed to the Doctrine of Devils or Daymons: For what is there that is more generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained both in Papiſtry, yea, and in Proteſtantiſm too; than doting and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, if not damnable Doctrines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39302:12"/>Angels, <hi>Genii,</hi> Spirits, Souls of men ſpreeting, Fiends, Devils,—which may be all called Daymons. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in our ſenſe, is fulfilled evidently enough in all the particulars; but not one particular of it ſo much, no not one, in Sixteen hundred years fulfilled, if by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Devils, Devils in the Pulpit, Preaching Devils, be underſtood: For in all this time, we do not yet read in any tolerable Author, yea, or Legendiſt, of ſo much as one Devil, that ever Preached ſo much as one Sermon, or vented one Doctrine out of the Pulpit, nor that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad Marriage, or commanded by his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to abſtain from Meats. I will not hence infer, That thoſe Doctrines (that forbid marriage, and command to abſtain from meats) are tolerable ſtill hitherto; becauſe it cannot yet be proved, that they were the Dictates or Doctrines of Devils Pulpetting it: But this I will ſay, That it is more honourable, auguſt, and credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſpirit of Truth, That ſuch an interpretation ſhould be embraced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his words, as may make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to Truth by the event, at leaſt within the compaſs of Sixteen hundred years, in one particular at leaſt: Not ſuch a one, as that in all that long, large and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39302:12"/>vaſt tract of Time, there can be found not one particular inſtance for the proof, ſo much as of one particular of theſe ſeveral predicated, to be fulfilled, likely to be fulfilled, or countenanced by the ſucceſs; but this might very well have been paſſed over as a meer Need-not: But that ſome men are mad in their opinions, conceits, and dreams; and as That was, ſo it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, to ſay, That the ſuggeſting, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of wicked Doctrines into mens hearts, is that which is here meant. Let it be at preſent ſuppoſed (and no Demono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt I think will oppoſe the ſuppoſition) That the Devil then did, and now doth, inject wicked thoughts, hereſies, villanies into mens hearts; yet then, he being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually Devil, and Men equally ſeduceable by him, then, as now, That he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject villanies more multitudinous for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or more abominable for nature, now, than then, can hardly be ſuppoſed. 2. It is the general opinion of Demonologers, That by Obſeſſion, and Poſſeſſion, the Devil domineered more unreſtrainedly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the World in the Primitive times, than in theſe latter; and if ſo, Why not by injections too as much? I ſee not. 3. That Doctrines as wild, were broached about the time the Apoſtles wrote, as ever were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39302:13"/>in any time afterward (except it be this Doctrine of Devils here ſpoken of) is beyond controverſy, as is evident by the mad Doctrines of the <hi>Simoniani, Pyletii, Hyminaei, Alexandrii, Nicholaitani, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoraei, Gaulonitae, Nazaraei, Judaeo-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gani, Moſco-Chriſtiani, Platonici, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogoniſtae, Phariſaei, Sadducaei, Eſſaei, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodiani, Egyptii, Gnoſtici.</hi>—4. Again, had the Apoſtle meant Doctrines ſuggeſted by Devils, or Doctrines ſo wicked and abominable, as none but Devils would, or could be ſuppoſed the Authors of them, he might have ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

I add, The Doctrines here by the Apoſtle mentioned, are but poor, ſmall, petty, trivial, and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heterodoxes, in compariſon of thoſe broached concerning Devils in theſe latter days: What are Prohibitious of Marriage, and Injunctions for the abſtinence from ſome kind of meats, in compariſon of comparing, yea, of preferring of Saints and Martyrs, yea, Devils and Witches, and abhor ſuch baſe Varlots with, or before Chriſt, for ſtupendious miracles? Did the Holy Ghoſt ſpeak ſo expreſly againſt thoſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39302:13"/>leſſer, ſmaller, pettyer and more trivial Heterodoxes, and omit to ſpeak againſt thoſe greater, groſſer, more villainous, yea, moſt blaſphemous, moſt idolatrous, and moſt ſacrilegious Doctrines? 6.

The means, way or courſe, by which this Doctrine ſhould be brought in, by forged lyes, falſe inventions, and hypocritical fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: But this is not that that I mean, but that the broachers of this doctrine of Devils are ſo plainly deſcribed, and indigitated here, that we may as eaſily know, who they be that are here meant, as we can know a ſhaven Monk, or Fryer by his ſhaven Crown, from an honeſt Man. 1. They are Lyers, <gap reason="foreign">

And yet, 7. The broachers of this doctrine of Devils are further yet pointed at in theſe words, <hi>Forbidding to marry, and a commanding to abſtain from meats.</hi>—Now if there have not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore been, and yet now are, many ſuch broachers in whom all the particulars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned do meet, within the Popedom; if there have not been, and yet are even in Proteſtantdom ſome too, that have, and do give heed to ſuch doctrines, then is not this Propheſy as yet, nor ever will, in any ſort be fulfilled: But it is as clear as the light even at noon-day, That there are an abundance of ſuch Doctors or broachers of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in the Popedom, as appears by thoſe volumns of Legends, thoſe decades of Romances, thoſe huge tomes of Fables <pb n="22" facs="tcp:39302:16"/>that have been obtruded upon the World, by Monks, Fryers, and other ſhavelings there: It appears alſo by the many far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, faggots and bundles of Scribbles, though by Divines, Doctors, and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers among Proteſtants, in vindication of that doctrine; That there are an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of broachers and Doctors, as well as Sheepiſh followers and Apiſh imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, who give heed to this doctrine of Devils: So that the Spirit needed indeed to ſpeak expreſly againſt it; and againſt it here. Here he doth ſpeak expreſly; but though ſo expreſly againſt it, he hath and doth ſtill ſpeak; yet ſome will Teach, and others give good heed to it: So apt eager and wilful are Men, to refuſe whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom doctrines and the words of Truth, that their itching ears may be filled with prophane Fables, incredible Lyes, and monſtrous Tales of old Wives, which turn them from the Truth, to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of this doctrine of Devils. This interpretation is conſonant to Grammar, to the letter of the Text, and is fully juſtified by the ſucceſs in all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and therefore cannot I think, be excepted againſt. The doctrine of Devils, is the opinion, tenent, or Teach, of, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, or concerning Devils; their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39302:16"/>power, and moſt prodigious opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: This is the ſum and drift of this Tract. There is not here any, the leaſt intention ſo much as to inſinuate, 1. That there be no Devils. Or 2. That they are not abominably villainous in themſelves. Or 3. That they are not miſchievous, to the utmoſt of their power, againſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: But only, That they have not ſuch an unlimited, irreſiſtible, and omnipotent power, as Demonologers idolatrouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to them; eſpecially in Phyſical or natural things, what-ever their power may be in reſpect of Morals. That is another queſtion.</p>

               <p>THis doctrine of the unlimited power of Devils in naturals, thus by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians entertained, is the higheſt and moſt abominable Apoſtacy, that ever was or can be in reſpect of Chriſt. We need go no further than this very Text for the proof of this. This Text no doubt is ſet in oppoſition to the laſt verſe of the former Chapter; where the Apoſtle having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Myſtery of Godlineſs by the manifeſtation of God in the fleſh, the wonderful operations of this God-man Chriſt, the admiration Angels had for him, his univerſal goodneſs as offered to all Men, the belief that was generally through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, againſt all credibility yielded unto him, his glorification, and in his, ours: He ſubjoyns this, <hi>That there ſhall be a departing from the faith:</hi> What Faith? Why, from the Faith of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars before mentioned. However, in what ſhall this departure be manifeſted or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:39302:17"/>ſhewn? Why, in part and ſpecially, by giving heed to ſeducing Spirits and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Devils: So that the giving heed to, the attending, obſerving, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining or believing of this doctrine of Devils, is a denying, refuſing, reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, or a departing from thoſe great Myſteries and fundamental points of the Chriſtian Religion: As particularly, a denying of, or a departing from, or a rejecting of that ſtupend miracle of Chriſt's Incarnation, and the benefits that proceed from it. 2. An abuſing or vilifying of his moſt wonderful operations. 3. A taking off of that great admiration, that Angels had before juſtly of him. 4. A denyal, or abuſing of that univerſal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he offered unto all mankind. 5. A vilifying of that wonderful recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Doctrine and Goſpel through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World at the firſt Preaching, though for the ſtrangeneſs of it to Mans natural and carnal underſtanding, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to be entertained. 6.

It is poſſible that the Demonologers will ſtrain hard, to wring out ſome nice, obſcure, or critical difference between this true and unqueſtionable Union of the two natures in Chriſt, and this fained one of Devils to Men; but certainly, if as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monologers ſay, a Devil or an evil Fiend can act mans body, ſo as to move, carry, roodge, hurry, tranſport it as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, make it light or heavy, quantitive or not quantitive, viſible or inviſible too, make it ſwim like a piece of Cork, dive like a Fiſh, fly like a Bird, the natural capacity of ſuch a Perſon, yea his Reaſon, Will, Intellect, Judgment, — all the powers and faculties of his Soul, being not only guided, governed or directed by, but ſwallowed up and metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the will, humour, nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, inclination—of the Devil; the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:39302:19"/>difference I ſuſpect, will be very nice, or rather none at all.

               <p>I have in another place toucht upon the particular mode of the Hypoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union of the two natures in Chriſt, and have ſhewn, That as that was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> Inſeparate: So according to the doctrine of Devils is the coagulation of Devil to Man in the poſſeſſed, in all and every reſpect anſwerable. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here now add but theſe few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. 1. That this Union of Devils to Men, in this ſuppoſed Poſſeſſion, ſeems a more difficult, hard and more unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible miracle, than that of the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt: That being but the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aleſcency of two Natures into one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, this the jumbling together of two numerical diſtinct and ſubſiſtent perſons
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:39302:19"/>into one Individual; There may in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it were, be ſome kind of dark Adumbration of that; ſome inſtance in the Miſſeltoe growing out of, or upon, and ſubſiſting in the Oak, without any proper ſubſiſtency of its own: But how well this agrees, let the Authors of the conceit well conſider (There was, it is generally known, throughout this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) not many years ſince, a Perſon, that had another body, living creature, or (if you will) another Perſon grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of his ſide, but ſubſiſted meerly by, and in the other Perſon, as a Ciens ingrafted doth in the Tree: But beſt of all, is this the Hypoſtatical Union of the two Natures in Chriſt, adumbrated by the Union of the ſpiritual and corporeal parts in Man: For as the reaſonable Soul and Fleſh is one Man, ſo God and Man is one Chriſt, as the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed hath it. There be many reſemblances of this it ſeems, but not any kind of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umbration as yet found in nature, how to ſhadow out the conſubſtantiation of two perfect, compleat and ſubſiſtent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals in one perſon: And yet, which is conſiderable too; 2. God thought it needful to ſend an Angel, even one of his mightieſt, moſt honourable, moſt elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:39302:20"/>and moſt powerful, even the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> to the bleſſed Virgin her ſelf, To perſwade her into the belief of the poſſibility of that, whereas (they ſay) That the Union of Devils unto Man, is eaſily credible, and generally believed without half that trouble: Strange, That the ſtranger thing, ſhould be more eaſily believed, than the eaſier! 3. But yet further, There was great ado, and much trouble about it, To unite Man to God, the omnipotency of the holy Ghoſt, and the power of the Almighty God were imployed, and all needful for the effecting of it: Where the Devil (as the <hi>Ichneumon</hi> into the <hi>Crocodile</hi>) can ſlip into mens mouths with eaſe as they gape, and poſſeſs them wholly as their own members: And yet again 4. In the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God himſelf, It was needful, That much time, even Thirty years and more, ſhould be ſpent, (I will not ſay, for the ſubjugating of the Manhood to an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diential ſubjection towards the Godhead, but) for the clearer manifeſtation of the reality of that Union; yea, and Three or four years of continual Miracles to boot: Where the Devil can incarnate himſelf, poſſeſs, or enter into a Perſon, make him ſubſervient to his will, beck
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:39302:20"/>or nodd, and manifeſt himſelf unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably to be the <hi>Dominus fac totum</hi> in the Perſon, and all that with the turn of a hand in an inſtant. 5. I might add God never did that Miracle but once, the Devil doth ſuch as are parallel every way, and <hi>Super</hi>-paramount to it every week, and day, for many Thouſand years together; ſo that in truth, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſeems to be the greater Miracler, as out-doing, out-going, out-ſtretching the Omnipotent God, in that very particular that he counts his Maſter-piece. God manifeſted in the fleſh, is no ſuch great Myſtery, the Devil can, and doth do as great, or greater every day. Oh into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable opinion! that yields ſuch blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous reſults; Devilmongers will no doubt diſclaim this charge, but they ſhall never be able to evade the guilt.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BUt Secondly, as this Doctrine, in the point of poſſeſſion, undervalues the Myſtery of Chriſts Incarnation: So doth it more abuſe Chriſt in the crotchet of Diſpoſſeſſion. A Devil, nay, a Witch (ſay they) by the Devils power, can eject or caſt out Devils out of any one poſſeſſed: Firſt, out of a Perſon where there never was any Devil. But Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Satan caſts not out Satan, elſe his houſe ſhould be divided, and his Kingdom could not ſtand:</hi> And yet hath and doth it ſtand ever ſince, though, at leaſt (as the doctrines of Devils aſſert) Satan hath caſt out Devils or Satan, all the World over, for theſe Sixteen hundred years: Thus therefore, this doctrine makes Chriſt a lyer: And which is as bad, it attributes more power to the Devil, than ever Chriſt (though he appeal to his ſtupend works for the juſtification of his Godhead) ever exerted while here
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:39302:21"/>on earth. Chriſt never ſo much as caſt out one Devil; I know men generally run away with this conceit, becauſe of theſe notions, caſt out Devils, or cured a Demoniack, or one poſſeſſed as we render it: But if we conſider, That the Scripture ſpeaketh but according to the mode and phraſe of times then, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (according to the conceit of Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing Phariſees) all great diſeaſes, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or diſtempers, wherein they thought (as they did in all almoſt) That there was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſome extraordinary and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural agency; we may, and will be eaſily ſatisfied, That when Chriſt is ſaid to caſt out Devils, they were but dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſeaſes, uncommon maladies, or extraordinary diſtempers, or elſe (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſins) that are meant.</p>

They cryed, they roared, they talkt fooliſhly, ran into mountains, and deſarts, and tombs, cutting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſtones, brake their fetters, were miſchievous to Paſſengers; but have not, may not, do not Madmen do all theſe things? <hi>By their works ye ſhall know them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; why, how, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then, may they not be Madmen, and Madmen meerly, that are meant by <hi>Demonium habentes,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

And argues largely from it, to juſtify himſelf and actings: But never did or could the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Children caſt out re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Devils; otherwiſe Men ſhould be ſtronger than Devils, Fleſh than Spirits: And yet a ſtronger than he muſt come
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:39302:24"/>upon him to diſpoſſeſs him without doubt; And is Man ſtronger than the Devil? Can <hi>Tom Thumb</hi> with his Ruſhen Spear, diſmount King <hi>Arthur</hi> and all his Knights? No more can meer Man diſpoſſeſs the Devil; eſpecially, if he be ſo omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently powerful, as Demonologers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate him. Devils in Scripture are ſet out as powers in the abſtract, Men as the abſtracts of weakneſs: Now that weakneſs in the abſtract, ſhould diſpoſſeſs power in the abſtract, is, I think alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inconceivable by any humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect. <hi>Canſt thou draw out Leviathan with a fiſh hook,</hi> (ſaid God to <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>or can a Criſmer, a Child of a ſpan long, bind Behemoth with a ruſhen cord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort thus, all that the Children of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> caſt out, were Diſeaſes, not Devils; all that Chriſt caſt out, was but what the Children of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> caſt out; therefore all that Chriſt caſt out, were but Diſeaſes and not Devils. And is it not now, then a moſt monſtrous Apoſtacy, and moſt intolerable Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that even to the Devil himſelf, to attribute ſuch an excellency of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Devil, which was never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted by Chriſt himſelf, indeed could not; becauſe there was never occaſion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:39302:25"/>for it. Well, this is one reſult of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils, it is an Apoſtacy from that fundamental Truth, <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> This was almoſt (but it muſt not be) forgotten here, That though Chriſt caſt not out any real Devil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called; yet curing Diſeaſes in ſuch a manner as he did, He manifeſted forth his Glory and Godhead, as fully, and as much, as if he had indeed caſt out real Devils; but of this in another place. I have ſpoken fully enough. I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly add this here, If they had been indeed real Devils, or infernal fiends that Chriſt caſt out, there might peradventure have been poſſibly ſome probable ground, of that ſtupend blaſphemy of the <hi>Phariſees, viz. He caſteth out Devils by Beelzebub.</hi>— In ſome ſort it might be credible, either by ſome favour, connivance, comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, complotment, or elſe envy, hatred, oppoſition of Devils; ſo that it had been no miracle or argument at all, to prove his Godhead. That he caſt out Devils; a <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> an <hi>Apollonius,</hi> yea an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Witch have done as much: But there could be no complyance, compact— envy, hatred—between Chriſt and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes. The curing therefore of Diſeaſes, in ſuch a manner as he cured them, was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:39302:25"/>more for Chriſts Honour, and the proof of his Godhead, than (if <hi>per impoſſibile,</hi> there could be any ſuch thing) the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Devils or infernal fiends could have been.</p>

               <p>I Do not ſay, that there is no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for this: No, I know there be many others, as his Cardiagnoſtical excellency, his infinite love to enemies, obſtinate and deſperate enemies, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible prophetick Spirit, the Star at his Birth, the Earthquake and Eclipſe at his Death, the ſtrange things at his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and his Reſurection it ſelf, as ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend a Miracle as any elſe that ever was—But none, I ſay, that Chriſt appeals unto, none that he uſeth ſo much,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:39302:28"/>or ſo often, as this of his Miracles acted by himſelf. The Atteſtation given him by his Father out of Heaven (which though it were not a Miracle wrought by him; yet was a Miracle wrought in order to the honour of him, and ſo in ſome ſort may be reckoned, as one of his Miracles) he uſeth too indeed, and one or two more peradventure; but put them all together, he uſeth not any, or all of them, ſo often by half, as this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Miracles. I know, ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his Holineſs, as an eſpecial Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove his Godhead, but this ſure can be no ſufficient proof; for his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Holineſs (though it were indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, yet) being but internal, and ſo inviſible, it could be no Argument at all; <hi>Idem eſt non eſſe, &amp; non apparere;</hi> It is a kind of contradiction, to ſay an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible mark: And for the outward Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it was not ſo tranſcendent, elevate, or reſplendent, but many might and did equalize him; yea he himſelf equalizeth, if not preferreth <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for outward Holineſs, auſterity, and ſtrict converſation: <hi>John came</hi> in a way of Holineſs, <hi>neither eating nor—The Son of Man is come eating and drinking, Mat.</hi> 11.18, 19. God in an admirable
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:39302:28"/>providence, thinking it fit to cloud his eſſential Holineſs, and to ſuffer but ſome ſmall glimmerings of it to ſhine forth, that we might not be ſcared, nor diſcouraged from an endeavour to imitate him, and to tread in his ſteps: Beſides, Holineſs is not ſo eaſie to be ſtated, as that Chriſts outward Holineſs ſhould be an irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable Argument of his Divinity: And if indeed we look upon his outward Actions only, as a man meerly; his Holineſs may not appear ſo exact, as to be a ſufficient preſident for our imitation. Not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his furniſhing the Gueſt with more Wine, when they had drank enough, if not more than enough before; ſome of the preciſer ſort, would think this was not ſo fit in another Perſon: Nor to touch at his cures, and works on the Sabbath day, which ſome of our Sabbatarians will ſcarce allow of now. I pitch upon his curſing of the fig-tree, for not having fruit, when the time of fruit (as to that tree) was not yet come: As alſo upon his permitting ſo many Hogs (the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful goods of innocents, for ought we know) at leaſt, of men, who never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him or his, (for ought we can col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) to be deſtroyed at the interceſſion of (as ſome call them) malicious Fiends,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:39302:29"/>or Devils. Look upon theſe, I ſay, and ſome other Acts of Chriſt, as the Acts of a meer Man, and they are hardly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiable: But look upon them as the Acts of God (and he proves his Godhead meerly by his works) and then no doubt, from his Prerogative Royal, his Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Juſtice, and abſolute Authority, he might do all this, and more, yet nothing but Goodneſs, Holineſs and Juſtice, in all his Actings. Nay more, one year of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, yea one Month, or one Day, or one Miracle, proves more than Forty years of Holineſs: This might be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited, even for ſo long time, as Chriſt lived upon the earth, (as Demonologers ſay, and concede) and the hypocriſie not be diſcovered in all that time; but a true Miracle is the Work only of an Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent God. A Miracle therefore proves irrefragably, though but one.</p>
               <p>Neither could the ends, aims, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the iſſues of Chriſts oeconomy here, be a ſufficient proof for his Godhead (whatever ſome think) theſe being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to all Spectators and Auditors; and not intelligible poſſibly in a very long time: How could theſe beget, or ſettle a belief? They might be but pretended,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:39302:29"/>and not real; they could be only Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the <hi>Poſtnati,</hi> not to theſe that lived in his own time: And thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves, at leaſt ſome of them, might not be, nay were not, true and well-grounded believers; ſince they could not ſee the ends, aims, intentions or iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues of Chriſts undertakings; much leſs could they be Martyrs and competent witneſſes unto us of the truth of Chriſts Godhead; yea or of his Doctrines. Nor do Chriſts Doctrines (ſome urge this) (though the excellenteſt and moſt Divine, without doubt, that can poſſibly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Sons of Men, either for their Moral or Eternal Good, or elſe for the exalting of Gods Honour) be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his Divinity, without his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: For (not to ſay what ſome uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſay in their Apologies for the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, That it is not altogether new, as ſome objected) That there is no Doctrine in Chriſts Goſpel ſo excellent, heavenly, and gloriouſly Moral, as to the practical part, but ſome Philoſopher or other hath given the ſelf-ſame precepts before his coming, that Chriſt did, <hi>viz.</hi> Theſe tranſcendent moral ones, of loving God with all, and above all, and our Neighbours as our ſelves; forgiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:39302:30"/>intreating Enemies like Friends, Patience, Humility, Martyrdom for the Truth, though without doubt not ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, convincingly, incouragingly upon ſuch threats and promiſes: I ſay, that there is one Doctrine of his, would ſpoil all the receptibility of the whole Syſtem of Religion promulgated in his Goſpel, were it not, That his tranſcendent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable, unparalellable Miracles (which he wrought) fortified it as an unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Truth: I mean the Doctrine of his own Godhead, and his equality in all excellencies with the Supreme Being, from which he expects faith, obedience, and recumbency from men, for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, upon himſelf, as much as upon the great Jehovah. But this muſt needs by all rational Men, be accounted a moſt high Preſumption, <hi>Luciferian</hi> Pride, yea Blaſphemy and Sacriledg, (and one dead Fly is able to poiſon the whole Pot of Oyntment, one wild gourd will make the whole broth nauſeous and deleterious) and urge, force, compel them to reject, deteſt and abominate all the whole <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruclopedy</hi> of the Goſpel; had he not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved that Doctrine (as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently he did) by his incomparable Miracles. Did not the Pagans of old,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:39302:30"/>and the Turks now upon this ground in ſpecial, reject his Goſpel? And for the Jews it is known by Children, That they ſo blaſphemed his Doctrine, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted his Perſon, for this above all things; That he being but a Man, made himſelf the Son of God. This Doctrine of his Godhead, never did, will, can be digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any, but ſuch, as by unimitable Miracles (there is no other Argument for this) are convinced of it: And there was not, there could not a more ſufficient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument be brought for it, than that: 'twere Miracles that proved this Doctrine, yea and his Perſon too; not his Doctrine that proved either his Perſon or Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to be Divine. For his Perſon he might juſtly have been accounted the boldeſt Impoſtor; and for his Doctrine, the deſperateſt Heretick that ever was, had not his Miracles juſtified both.

               <p>BUt now this Doctrine of Devils takes off, abrogates, nullifies this Argument altogether: Whereas Chriſt, to prove himſelf to be the Son of God, ſaith, None could do ſuch Miracles as he did, his works juſtifie him, None ever did the like Works; this Doctrine tells us, That Devils, yea Witches by Devils help, can do as great for matter of work; as many, nay and Millions of Millions more for number; for time exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much longer, and for places, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thouſand Thouſand more. Who now (upon this ſuppoſition) the greater Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racler? Who the better Man, who the greater God, God or <hi>Baal;</hi> Chriſt or the Devil? Chriſt turned Water into Wine, and it was ſo manifeſt an Argument of his Power and Godhead, That his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were convinced, they did, and they thought they ought to believe on him. Chriſt cured Men at a diſtance by his meer Word, walked ſteadily on the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:39302:31"/>commanded the Storms to ceaſe, and was obeyed preſently; curſed the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and it withered away ſtraight: He fed Five thouſand Men, with five Loaves and two Fiſhes; raiſed Men that had been dead, yea dead four days before: Chriſt could and did transform himſelf into a moſt glorious luſtre, both his Body and Garments. — By ſuch Miracles and ſtupend Works, Chriſt manifeſted it forth, That he was the Son of God, that we ought to believe in him, and that thus believing, we ſhould have life through his name, <hi>John</hi> 20.31. But this Doctrine of Devils tells us, That a Devil can turn himſelf into a Man or Woman, a Rat, Cat, or Dog at pleaſure; and that a Witch can be any creature that ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to perſonate: They can cure Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or any other ſick Perſons at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; can walk and fly in the Air, yea ride in that fluid element, with Coach and ſix Horſes; can raiſe Storms of a ſudden, and allay them in an inſtant; can blaſt, not only a ſingle Tree, but a whole Wood or Forreſt; can turn a Town into Aſhes in the twinkling of an eye; with a wry look can kill as many as he liſts, and raiſe them again at his pleaſure. — Stories more than a good
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:39302:32"/>many, may be produced out of Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nographers for all theſe particulars; but what need more, this is a <hi>Conclamatum eſt,</hi> an Axiomatical Truth among the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of Demonology, That a Devil or Witch can, for ſtupendiouſneſs of the work do as much as ever Chriſt did; only the doubt is of the Shibboleth, or the Characteriſtical note, How ſhall we diſtinguiſh, how ſhall we know them one from another, is not this blaſphemy?</p>

               </head>
               <p>NAy they attribute to their Devils and Witches ſome things, that do indeed much exceed the things that are recorded of Chriſt, of the ſame nature too: Chriſt raiſed one that was dead four days; the Devil or a Witch, can raiſe a Man, though dead four Months, and more, as <hi>Cautius</hi> — Nay Four years (peradventure) as <hi>Samuel:</hi> The Devil or a Witch by his help, ejects a real Devil (as 'tis ſaid) which Chriſt (as I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:39302:32"/>have proved) never did. Chriſt fed Five thouſand Men once, with an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable pittance: the Devil out of a glewiſh dew, can and often doth, mould up ſo many various diſhes of choice Viands, and Butts of laſcivious Wines, that many Thouſands may ſill, and feed, and feaſt themſelves moſt deliciouſly; and for a need, can raiſe a moſt glorious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, in the midſt of a deſolate Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to entertain his gueſts in ſtate. (and not ſuffer them to ſit upon the cold Graſs) and all in an inſtant. Chriſt could in a ſhort time convey himſelf from one ſide of the Channel to the other: Pagh, this is but a poor trick, A Witch can be at ſeveral Places very far diſtant, at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſelf-ſame inſtant; as <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Magdalena, Crucia.</hi> Nay again, Chriſt indeed did many Miracles, but 'twas Four thouſand years after the World begun, ere he began to do any: The Devil in all Ages, from the beginning of the World, had done many Millions before Chriſt was born. Chriſt continued do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch things but Three or Four years, in Perſon, nor above Fifty or Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by his Apoſtles; He and they began later, continued but a ſhort time, and have been doing ſuch things, even about
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:39302:33"/>Sixteen hundred years ſince: Where the Devil, as he began many Thouſand years before Chriſt or his Agents did ſo much as one Miracle, and will ſo continue to the end. Chriſt did a few Miracles in a corner of the World, a canton of <hi>Aſia,</hi> a nook of <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> where the Devil hath, doth, and will do his Miracles all the World over. Chriſt did his Miracles, among a peeviſh, fooliſh, ſottiſh people, (as the World accounted them) the Jews and his own Apoſtles: The Devil doth his among the Politicians, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, the wizers of the World. Chriſt did his Miracles a great while ago, and a great way off, and who can tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were any ſuch thing or no? We have but hereſay, tradition, a few old Books written by his own favourites, and commented upon by his hypocondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack Friends; where, for the Godhead of Devils, we may our ſelves be eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and ear-witneſſes of it, in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles every day; may behold them if we will be ſo bold (or elſe our Demono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Doctors tell old Wives Fables:) few and poor, paltry and ſuſpicious, are the Miracles of Chriſt, compared to thoſe of a Witch or Devil; if we will believe the teachers of this doctrine concerning
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:39302:33"/>Devils. But whether that Doctrine, that yieldeth ſuch undervaluing conceits, in reſpect of Chriſt, be allowable, I leave to the Conſciences of Chriſtians to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BUt go we on, and ſee how, and with what reſpect, this Doctrine uſeth the Holy Ghoſt: Two glorious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable excellencies, we Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly believe, do belong to that Divine and Infinite Spirit; the firſt is, a beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a prophetick Power, whereby a Perſon, through an extraordinary and ſupernatural aſſiſtance, is enlightened, and lightned to ſuch an elevation of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he can foretel, not only future and far diſtant, but even contingent things; ſuch as depend meerly upon the will of Man and God. I mean not, That extatical or rapturous emotion of Spirit, whereby Men may ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and predict (when they have not any abſolute certainty of) futurities; however confident the Diviners may be of their predictions. The other is, the Grace and Practice of Piety, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Duties, in order to a conformity with the Divine Will: Theſe are two ſpecial
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:39302:35"/>and proper effects of, or emanations from that Infinitely Gracious Spirit. Who-ever attributes either of theſe, to any other origine, ſacrilegiouſly ſteals from that bleſſed Spirit, a ſpecial part of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, idolizing moſt baſely that Perſon, Thing or Creature, to which he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth them. This I take is undeniable, but both of theſe (ſaith the Doctrine of Devils) may be inſufflated from Hell. A Perſon may be very pious in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Religious in obſervation of Duties, conſtant in Reading, Hearing, Praying privately as well as in publick; ready, willing, earneſt to inſtruct others in the Myſteries of the Creed, and exhort them to the duties contained in the Decalogue; may be ready to offer them the Cordials of the Goſpel in their Agonies; and in their extravagancies, to terrify them with the ſeverity of Gods vengeance: This is well enough known by a late example. Such a one accuſed for a Witch upon Oath, and hardly eſcaped the extreameſt puniſhment; but that ſome of the petty Jury were well acquainted with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Yea, 2. A Perſon may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict things future and meerly contingent, and all by meer inſuſurration, from the Devil; for the former I have hinted an
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:39302:35"/>example: For the latter I may produce <hi>Magdalena Crucia:</hi> Nay ſhe may paſs for an unexceptionable example of both. For (ſaith the great Demonologiſt of this latter Age) for ſuch things got ſhe the reputation of a very Holy Woman, and a great Propheteſs; and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with the Devil, as his Wife, for Thirty years together. Cannot the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil make Saints too as well as Prophets? Yea Prophets and Saints too both. Nay, and ſince <hi>Omne efficiens tale eſt magis ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> muſt not that thing which we call Devil, be a moſt good and godly thing? Equal to the Holy Ghoſt, for Holineſs and for Knowledg? Whether this be not ſuch groſs abuſe, to that Infinitely Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Spirit, that comes very near that grand ſin called Irremiſſible; I leave it to Chriſtians to examine and conclude: And yet doubtleſs, meer naturaliſts would be aſhamed to attribute the excellencies of the Godhead, to the worſt of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. I might have inſtanced in thoſe gifts mentioned by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.5, — 10. But I thought fit to pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe above-mentioned.</p>

The Devil keeps Tearms, and appears at
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:39302:36"/>the general Rendezvouz there (as 'tis ſaid): And if ſo, not for any good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, but in hope to get opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to uſurp that Province as well as the reſt. It is ſaid he can make and unmake Men, poſſeſs and diſpoſſeſs, kill and make alive, raiſe ſtorms and tempeſts, <hi>Eurocli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi> Hurry-canoes, make Women and Years fruitful or barren, ſend Lightnings, Thunders and Earth-quakes, infect with Plagues, Peſtilences, and contagious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, kindle and conſume with Fire whole Towns, Villages and Cities, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell things meerly contingent; ſtop the Sun in its courſe, and reſtrain the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Moon, and all the Stars—Is not this a God?

               <p>MEn uſually ſhelter themſelves under this conceit, as a ſecure <hi>Aſylum</hi> for their abominable blaſphemy, (in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the proper works of God to the Devil): Oh! God permits him, and then he can do (yea marry can he) wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſtupend feats. I might in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer return, this Permiſſion is but a meer invention, a fiction, a <hi>Chimera</hi> here. But I ſay, let God permit the Devil never ſo much, let him give him the full length of his own cord, and not reſtrain or ſnaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle him in the leaſt; yea cannot the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil be able to do any of theſe works that are proper to God: Permiſſion is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering; but a meer liberty of exerting a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> natural power. If therefore there be not a natural power to do the works of God; Gods permitting of the Devil, the exerciſe of his natural power to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, will not enable or make him the apter to do them: Let looſe the rains to your Horſe, give him the greateſt liberty
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:39302:37"/>can be thought of, without any the leaſt check, yea urge him too with Switch and Spur, hee'l never the more be able to mount up into the Air, to ſoar aloft, fetch his Cancileers, or make his ſtops like a Hawk. Permit an Aſs to take the Lute, though never ſo well ſtringed, ſet and tuned; yet will he never be able to play ſo much as one ſweet Leſſon, or good Tune. Permit you curp, hinder him not, let him do his beſt, hee'l never be able to pronounce an Oration with any elocution or grace, but be mute as a Fiſh ſtill. Permiſſion ſignifieth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the freedom of exerting the natural power; if there be no natural Power, Permiſſion implants none: This therefore is to be proved firſt, That the Devil in, of, by, and from himſelf, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally hath the Power of God, and left to himſelf, can do as ſtupend Works as God, yea the ſame that God chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth as proper to himſelf. Can this be proved? He that proves this, proves in effect and truth, by the ſame proof, That the Devil hath the Power of God too, and in himſelf, and can do the Work of God, without any permiſſion from God: And conſequently, That he is God equal for power to the great God;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:39302:38"/>nay, and if he have the Power of God in, and of himſelf, he can do the Works of God in ſpight of God or his permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; yea, and which is more (yet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from theſe premiſes of Permiſſion) The Devil can ſo ſpight God, that God without the Devils permiſſion, cannot do his own works, can do no good nor evil, can do nothing: For though, <hi>Par in parem non habet poteſtatem imperandi, deſtruendi</hi>—yet may he have, <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatem reſiſtendi, oppugnandi,</hi>—if the Devil have in himſelf the Power of Gods proper Works, he hath the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, and ſo can do them without Gods Permiſſion as well as with it; yea as well as God himſelf can do them without the permiſſion of the Devil. Is not this good ſtuff? Yet follows from the ſuppoſition of Permiſſion. Is not this with <hi>Manes,</hi> to bring in two Gods, a good and a bad one, and yet of equal force, power, ſtrength and virtue? Nay, Is it not with <hi>Diagoras,</hi> To deny all gods? He that makes more than one, allows truely and indeed none.</p>

Delegation ſuppoſeth the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legator either not preſent, or not able to work, or that he is ſtately and ſcornes to work: But where or whence can the

And he that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth care for Oxen, feedeth alſo the young Ravens, orders the motion of a Sparrow, provides clothes for the graſs of the Field—is not over-ſtately: Or 5. What is it? Is God grown ſo weak, weary, decrepit or unwieldy? we read he is the Ancient of days indeed, is he grown decrepit, needs he a writ of Eaſe or Dotage? Is he not able to manage the great Province of the World any longer, that he muſt have his Delegates?

Or elſe Sixthly, ſuppoſe this too, was there none fitter, none abler, none better to be his under-agent, than the Devil?

Oh! in what a ſad condition are we, is this World in, the while? But 7. Doth not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:39302:39"/>this ſuppoſe the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> to be a meer Epicurean Idol, a Lurdan, or an Abby-Lubber, or rather, which is as bad, an Impotent Weakling? <hi>Epicurus</hi> indeed thought his God ſomewhat ſlothful, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lazy and foggy; but that he could if he would, manage the affairs of the World well enough; but for foggineſs could not: Theſe make him an impotent God, he cannot, or at leaſt not conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he faints and tires, if he take not his nap, his eaſe, his tumble upon the bed, if he be ſtill upon his work, and buſineſs; he muſt get his Subſtitute, a Deputy, and (rather than fail) the worſt of Ten thouſand; and thus all things, for that time (and how long that time may be who can know) may (if not muſt) go againſt the rocks for him. He hath no Providence (I touch upon this in ſhort, having ſpoken larger in another place) and if no Providence, no God, and it is a Miracle if the World, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſuddenly be not, nay, That the World hath not long ſince been jumbled and brought into his old Chaos, a <hi>Tohu</hi> and <hi>Bohu,</hi> yea into a meer <hi>Barathrum,</hi> a <hi>Tophet,</hi> a <hi>Gehenna.</hi> The Doctors of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monology, Predicate, Preach and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, That the Devil is the God of this

One Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>In the latter times, ſome will obſtinately worſhip Devils, That will be the great villany in the latter age;</hi> The other ſaith, <hi>They will give heed to the doctrine of Devils:</hi> Put both together and this is the reſult, They that give heed to the doctrine of Devils, are the great Apoſtates, and obſtinate worſhippers of the Devil, which is the worſt and moſt abominable Idolatry of the latter times, or ever was in any time. Nor let them think to evade, by ſaying,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:39302:41"/>That the worſhippers of the Devils in the Apocaliptiſt, are meerly Pagans, that worſhip the Devil carnally, viſibly, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreally in an outward ſhape, or body aſſumed. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1.

Suppoſe this true, That the Devil could do this, yea and that the Pagans in <hi>Eutopia,</hi> do worſhip him, as ſo; carnally accoutred, this excuſeth not our Demonologers, nor anſwers the meaning of the Apocalipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Divine, he ſpeaks of things and ſins, that will be frequent in, with, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong perſons, that live within the pale of the Church: What is it to purpoſe, To talk by way of an accommodate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, of Men that now and ever will be meer Aliens, from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Chriſt? 4. As the Fornicators, Thieves, Sorcerers—are all to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted in a myſtical, or metaphyſical ſenſe, ſo no doubt are Devil-worſhippers too, not Perſons, that bow down their bodies to the perſon or carnal repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Devil, or any other way expreſs their reverence to him corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:39302:41"/>but that bow down their Souls, Hearts, and Intellects, by receiving, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining, broaching, mentioning and improving Tenents, Doctrines and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to his Honour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor will they eſcape by ſaying, That they do not worſhip the Devil; for (forſooth) they do not Invocate, Supplicate, or by Prayer make any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to him. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe; for firſt Invocation, Prayer, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, are but outward, or at leaſt but ſecondary acts for the Soul towards the thing adored: There is a former, primer, higher action, whereby the Soul apprehends, believes, and applies the great things of the adored; which is worſhip properly and in chief: And thus Men may adore and worſhip, though they never Invocate, Pray or Supplicate. There be ſome Deiſts (I but name the Opinion and leave it to be diſcourſt of by others) who never did, cared, or thought it fit to Pray, they acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that God knew their deſires, wants, neceſſities, indigencies; that he was good, gracious, powerful, juſt, provident,— beyond all that they could ask or think; That they themſelves, knew not what nor how to ask, as they ſhould or ought,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:39302:42"/>and therefore that they caſt themſelves upon his goodneſs, for all things, and thought it needleſs to pray at all. So may it be with Demonomaniſts, they may not Invocate, and yet may they be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the Devil. 2. The prime acts of Worſhip, if not the very eſſence of it, are either, firſt, a Recumbency, Faith, Hope of ſome good, in, from, or upon ſome promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.8. Or elſe, 2.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:39302:42"/>for ſome good; yet if they do but fear him (as by the high eſteem they have of his Power, Policy, indefatigable Malice, and irreſiſtible Omnipotency to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, they muſt) or if they cry up and predicate theſe his abilities, ſo as to make others fear, and tremble at him (and they that make them are like unto them) or if they attribute any excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to him, more than they can juſtify to be due unto him, without Sacriledg, and Idolatry in reſpect of Chriſt; and God may, if <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I Need not ſay the condition of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (if the doctrine of Devils be authentick) muſt needs be miſerable, it is, it muſt be unſpeakably, and irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diably miſerable; the Devil may ſwagger, domineer, and play <hi>Rex</hi> where and when, upon, or with whom, and that as long, and as oft as he liſteth: He hath an Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Power, or the Power of God at leaſt, an everlaſting Commiſſion to be renewed everlaſtingly, as oft as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, Who ſhould curb, check, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul him? But I paſs this as to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and come to look upon ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial particulars. And here, firſt, I know not what to ſay or think of the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial proceedings at Law; I ſee not how they can be juſtified as conſcionable: The Grave, Reverend, Honourable Sages of the Law, are ſworn (I take it) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, <hi>Secundum allegata &amp; probata:</hi> This they are bound to, and this 'tis thought is an excellent courſe of Juſtice: Yet may
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:39302:43"/>it be ſure, <hi>Summum jus,</hi> the moſt rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unjuſteſt cruelty imaginable: the Party accuſed and ſworn againſt, might act but upon force, violence, and invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible neceſſity, Should not this acquit him of all guilt? <hi>per minas duces;</hi> or (at leaſt) compulſion, though but by Man, is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally allowed as a good plea: But if a Perſon may be forced, compelled, and violently conſtrained, or hurried, <hi>Volens nolens,</hi> by the Devil, a more irreſiſtible, though inviſible Power; (the Devil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly may enter into a Man, and irreſiſtibly move and force his Hands, Arms, Leggs and Tongue—whither, and to what he will, ſaith the doctrine of Devils, in the point of poſſeſſion) Can he be condemned juſtly? Can, will, or dare theſe judicious and conſcionable Perſons pronounce ſentence againſt him? Nay, can they at any time condemn any Man, for any Crime, Villany, or Piacle whatever, Murther, Inceſt, Beſtiality, Sodomy, Regicidiſm —? There muſt be ſufficient, ſatisfying and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing evidence of the fact, as perpetrated by ſuch a Perſon, ere they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him guilty; but this they never have, ſhall, or can have, if the Devil can take on mens ſhapes, forms, habits,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:39302:44"/>countenances, tones, gates, ſtatures, ages, complexions (as he did <hi>Samuels,</hi> ſay Demonologers, and a Thouſand inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more of the ſame kind will they far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle up to prove the thing) and act in the ſhape aſſumed; Who can with any aſſurance ſwear, who with any confidence believe, or who with any conſcience can condemn? It might be the Devil in Mans ſhape, and not the Man accuſed; 'tis Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice doubtleſs, that the guilty be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the innocent acquitted; but here the innocent muſt be condemned, and the guilty ſcape without any puniſhment: Is this Juſtice? I hope the Demonologers who have ſo long ſtudied the Black Art, and are by this time well acquainted with the ſubtileſt intrigues, retreats, and lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-holes of Satan, know when and where, and how he may be catched; and will inform the Court how he may be arreſted, arraigned, and executed, for his Villanies. I hope they will not, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with the Devil, everlaſtingly ſuffer the honeſt Party, to be ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, butcher'd and murthered, for the guilt meerly of that moſt notorious Malignant. But till then indeed, I do wonder who will, who can, who dare be a Judge, a Witneſs, or of the Inqueſt.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:39302:44"/>Is it poſſible that either of them can act in Faith, or with a ſafe Conſcience? <hi>He that juſtifieth the wicked, or condemneth the innocent, both theſe are abominable, Prov.</hi> 17.15. And yet the Judge, the Jury, Inqueſt and Witneſs, may do both theſe; and that by Rules of Juſtice, and Command of Gods: Can this conſiſt with the Truth, Goodneſs, Holineſs, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Philanthropy— of God? For my part I do not ſee, know or conceive, but that the Judge, Jury, and Inqueſt, are all ſo hemmed in, ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and beleguered, with ſuch a neceſſity of ſinning, that they cannot poſſibly get out (no not by Miracle) without ſin, one way or other: The Judge is drawn into the guilt of cruelty and injuſtice, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a Sentence of condemnation unjuſtly, againſt an innocent (which his Soul abhors) and yet muſt pronounce ſuch a Sentence if he proceed according to evidence; and yet if he proceed not according to evidence, he ſins of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity the ſin of perjury, ſince he is ſworn to proceed <hi>Secundum allegata, &amp; probata:</hi> The Witneſſes that ſwear, run into the guilt of Perjury too; as ſwearing to a falſity, or at leaſt to a thing againſt a Perſon, that they could not certainly be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:39302:45"/>aſſured 'twas true, or ſo as they ſwore: And yet if they do not witneſs and ſwear as required, they run into the guilt of concealing Felony, Murther, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſome more abominable guilt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the injury done to Juſtice, and the contempt of the Magiſtrate, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the publick. The Inqueſt too is forced into the guilt of conſpiracy, with both, as preſenting upon their Oathes, and Conſciences, ſuch a Perſon as guilty, (when innocent at leaſt as to them) they could not by this doctrine of Devils have ſufficient teſtimony of his guilt. And yet on the other ſide, if they preſent not what is ſworn to them by competent wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, being a crime, they are forſworn, ſince when they were admitted, they ſwore to preſent ſuch things. Judges, Inqueſt, Jury, Witneſſes and all muſt of neceſſity ſin one way or other; <hi>Auribus lupum,</hi> they are all me ſeems like the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in the Red-Sea; the Sea before and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> behind them; if they went forward they drowned themſelves, if ſtood ſtill, or went back, yielded themſelves to be Butchered; what courſe they ſhould take I knew not, and as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle know I, how the offices of Juſtice ſhould behave themſelves in this caſe:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:39302:45"/>Beſides, if a Villain taken in the very act of Murther, ſhould plead it was the violent compulſion, or irreſiſtible force of an inhabiting Devil, though inviſible to the ſpectator, that compelled him; I wonder how he can be condemned, though taken, as I ſaid, in the very act; if the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition be allowed, the juſtification can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gainſaid. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo odious to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> That they would with all their heart, have plucked him in pieces, and torn him piece after piece, one joynt from another; but when they acknowledged the Suppoſition of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, they could not deny the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> his Innocency, he was to be freed, they found no fault in him. If a Spirit or an Angel have ſpoken to him, we cannot fight againſt God; and yet what he had ſpoken was as a Stab, a Dagger, a Poniard ſtruck into their hearts: Had he murthered a Thouſand Men, they would never have been ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently ſet againſt him, as they were for the words he had ſpoken. Doubtleſs by the ſame reaſon, or peradventure more, if a Devil, by the Permiſſion, Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Command of God, or his own natural and irreſiſtible power, can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel a perſon to Murther, yea ſuppoſe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:39302:46"/>his Father, and ſuch a compulſion be pleaded; the Man is free, and cannot be condemned juſtly: The ſin muſt lie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe, on God, or the Devil at leaſt, Why ſhould the Man ſuffer? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the Doctrine in the Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts innocence, though a Murtherer, yea a Parricide, cannot but with abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity be denied. Here the abominable Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain may be excuſed, above the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teger innocents might be condemned; and yet which is a ſtrange Riddle, an intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Labyrinth, a monſtrous contradiction: The Witneſſes are innocent, they depoſe but what they ſaw; the Inqueſt are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, they preſent but what was ſworn to them; the Judge is innocent, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds but according to Proof, Law, Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Oath. Doubtleſs it will need <hi>Sphinx</hi> to explain thoſe <hi>Enigmata;</hi> for my part I cannot: If any Demonologer can, he may do well to do it, that the Judges, Jury, Inqueſt, and Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may appear and act at Aſſizes with a ſafe Conſcience; for truely things ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they do (according to this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils) I do not ſee why thoſe Judicial proceedings at Law ſhould be continued. They are without doubt in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:39302:46"/>themſelves the moſt neceſſary methods. (For the condition we are in, both for this Life, and the Life which is to come too, that Man, yea God himſelf could invent) without the Law and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it, we ſhould be but like Beaſts in the Forreſts here, and fare but like Devils in Hell hereafter. And yet upon this Hypotheſis of the Doctrine of Devils, there is no room, no place, no need, no uſe, or benefit by them at all; they may do more harm than good, the Officers of the Law may (be they never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable or incorruptible) nay do but act villany by a Law; and yet is this villainy heightned, aggravated, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandized into a greater dimenſion of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; in that it is done under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Law, under the countenance of Juſtice, under the Authority of God. God, Juſtice and Law, are all brought in as Acceſſaries to the (neceſſitated) injuſtice of the judicial proceedings. But nay, nay, if it be thus, away with all Law, away with Aſſizes, away with Judges, away with all Offices, Courts of Juſtice, and proceedings according to the Laws: They are dangerous and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous things; not to be tolerated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, nay nor any ſociety of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:39302:47"/>Men. But I ſtop, and ſay, rather away with Witchcraftical Doctors, away with the doctrine of Devils, for then Men may be able to believe their own eyes with confidence, may be believed by others upon their Oath, Law, Juſtice; and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial proceedings may be of uſe, Judges and the reſt of the Officers may take their places as heretofore, and act every one of them in their own Spheres, with a ſafe, quiet, and good Conſcience: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they cannot act in Faith, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not of Faith is Sin.</p>

                  <p>For (which may paſs for another Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) this Doctrine diſturbs our Reaſon, and obſtupifies it; it takes us off from all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination or Logical inferences; we think it rational to conclude, That heavy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies will ſink downward, but this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine will tell us another tale. <hi>viz.</hi> That an old Hagg, a withered and decrepit Witch that is as heavy as Lead, will ſwim like Cork in the Water, or as a Bird fly in the Air, that moſt ſoft, yielding, fluid and unreſiſting Element.

It was reported in the beginning of our late troubles, of a great and Arch-Covenanter, when preſſing the Covenant moſt zealouſly: He was urged with ſome arguments taken from Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the Covenanting way, by a Royaliſt; That he anſwered, we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny both Scripture and Reaſon too now, and help Jeſus Chriſt at this pinch. I did not indeed hear this my ſelf, but it might be true, yea and his zeal might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what excuſable, ſince 'twas for Chriſt. But I read I am ſure in many, in moſt Demonologiſts, ſeveral things that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite and contrary, both to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Scripture, and theſe urged fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as fundamental points of Religion, and all for the ſupport and maintainance of the Grandeur of that Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, againſt the honour and intereſt of Chriſt: If any Man can bring any thing of Reaſon or Scripture in excuſe of this, he may if he will, I would not if I
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:39302:50"/>could, indeed I cannot nor any Man elſe.</p>

                  <p>And yet more, It is a ſenſeleſs Doctrine this. A Doctrine I mean, that takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the certainty or benefit of our Senſes: We may think we ſee ſuch and ſuch things, ſuch and ſuch perſons which yet we ſee not; think we hear ſuch and ſuch ſounds, ſuch and ſuch diſcourſes which yet we hear not: Think we taſte and eat ſuch and ſuch viands, drink ſuch and ſuch luſcious wines which yet we do not; we may be hungry, and thirſty, and faint, for all our ingurgitating, pour and cram we in never ſo much: We have eyes and ſee not, ears but cannot hear or know we do ſo — Seeing, hearing, taſting, ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, feeling, may all deceive us according to this doctrine of Devils; And is this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be entertained by Chriſtians, yea or but by meer Men? When it even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans them, and impoſeth ſuch unmanly things upon them, That they muſt both renounce their Senſes and their Reaſon, or at leaſt not believe them, which is as bad.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:39302:51"/>and if it be true, <hi>Nihil eſt in intellectu quod non fuit prius in ſenſu;</hi> our ſenſes being deceived, our intellect muſt needs be deceived too ſtill; And thus, there is nothing but deceit and cheat upon us, both within and without; And is this an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that muſt be entertained by Men that pretend to Reaſon, yea or ſo much as to Senſe?</p>

               <p>IT is a Bloody, Barbarous, Cruel and Murtherous Opinion, an Opinion that Butchers up Men and Women without Fear or Wit, Senſe or Reaſon, Care or Conſcience, by droves; So many in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet,</hi> ſo many in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi>—ſo many in another County, Ten, Twenty, Thirty at a clap; Inquiſitors boaſt of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, yea Thouſands, that they have butchered up in a ſmall time, upon the account of Witchcraft. In the laſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles we had informations (that went all the Kingdom over) from Diurnals, and other more credible teſtimonies; That our Northern Zealots of <hi>Scotland</hi> butchered up many Hundreds (I am aſhamed to write the exact number becauſe it is ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous) in a very ſhort time more than there had been of all other ſorts of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals in Fifty years before, upon the conceit of this guilt; as many more in Jayl, who doubtleſs had run the ſame fate, had not providence prevented it. But of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:39302:52"/>all theſe that were impriſoned, there was but one that could be ſuſpected (when impartial and unbiaſſed perſons had the examination) and the ground of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion againſt him too, appeared at laſt ſo weak, frivolous, and contemptible, That though (to gratifie the humour of the peeviſh rabble) he was for a while de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Priſon, yet was at laſt too diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged as innocent. I could ſpeak of and have hinted the like in another place, though not in ſo great a number, and that to mine own knowledg; and indeed, if the Oaths of two baſe Varlets (that will ſwear any thing to work their revenge) may be taken, where no reality of fact can appear; Who almoſt that is old, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit, ill-favoured, and friendleſs can be ſecure? How readily will they ſwear? Imps and Puggs, ſupernatural and infernal Teats or Biggs, Conjurations, Compacts, Devils in ſuch and ſuch ſhapes; How oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en have they ſworn, Witches have turned themſelves into Cats, and in that ſhape ſighting with, and worſting the greateſt Maſtives? Into Hares too, and in that ſhape, outran the ſwifteſt Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds? How often have they ſworn, That after their falling out with ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſuch and ſuch miſchiefs have befallen
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:39302:52"/>them, as the meer effects of theſe Perſons malice; when all the miſchiefs, were but natural, and ſometimes antecedent, to all diſtaſtes between the parties. I have my ſelf known ſome, who ſwore ſuch and ſuch a miſchief, ſuch and ſuch a diſeaſe betide them, preſently upon the ſaying of ſuch a Perſon (well, I may meet with you, I will be quits with you, better you had, or better you had not done this— with a Curſe peradventure at the end) which yet were antecedent to any ſuch Curſe or threat upon them, being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary, or of a longer date than the curſe or threat. Some poſſibly were concom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant, and others ſubſequent; But that among the multitude of hurtful accidents (which all the Men in the World are ſtill ſubject unto) ſome one or other ſhould fall out, in ſuch a juncture of time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any relation, or dependance upon the curſe, or threat of the ſuppoſed Witch as the cauſe; he hath but a ſhallow, weak or narrow intellect that doth not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. In the matter of Theft, Murther, Burglary—there muſt be ſome real thing proved as actually done by ſuch a Perſon; the accuſed had power (it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) to do the fact, and the accuſer might have certainty enough, That it was
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:39302:53"/>done by ſuch a Perſon; but here in this caſe of Witchcraft, there can be no ſuch thing certain, it all goes upon groundleſs and inconceivable ſuppoſitions, ſurmiſes, conjectures, gueſſes, dreams, fancies; no certain aſſurance of any real connexion of ſuch an effect with ſuch a cauſe: And ſince, this many times ſerves, it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to me, That there be no greater herds, droves, flocks, ſwarmes—of witchcraftical criminals at every Aſſize. But that the Reverend Judges, eſpecially of <hi>England,</hi> now are much wiſer; (not only than the Proletarian rabble, but than they too, who profeſs themſelves to be the great Philoſophers, and well-ſtudied in the Magick art) and give ſmall or no encouragement to ſuch accuſations; and yet with the many, if one ſuch croſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident happen to be ſynchronical, or but ſubſequent to ſuch a Curſe or Threat; Oh! 'tis a pregnant proof, a certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, That ſuch a Witch was the cauſe; and yet a Hundred ſuch Curſes have been vented by the ſame Perſons and no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief followed, but they were not taken notice of, but this only that was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome miſchief following: But to end this, a wiſe Man tells us, That a cauſeleſs Curſe flies in vain; and if after
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:39302:53"/>or upon the venting ſuch a Curſe a miſchief happen, muſt that miſchief neceſſarily be the effect of that Curſe? if 'twere cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, 'twould bring no miſchief: If a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief be brought, it was deſerv'd, and then 'twere fitter ſure to look to the hand of Providence for the cauſe, than to the Tongue of a ſpightful Neighbour: Many Trophies and Gratulary Anathema's you may ſee hanged up in <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Temple by Men preſerv'd from Shipwrack through his Providence; why Sacrifice you not to him? ſaid one: I Sacrifice not to him, ſaid the other; becauſe there are Thouſands more, that have ſuffered Shipwrack, who have Sacrificed to <hi>Neptune,</hi> than ſcap't. One miſchief or other among the Myriad of various Accidents, that we are ſubject to, may ſeem ſomwhat Syncronical to ſuch a Curſe; but there have been a Thouſand ſuch Curſes, when no miſchief followed, and how then can the miſchief be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Curſe?</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:39302:54"/>Generation? the voice from Heaven (This is my beloved Son) might it not be a Deluſion too? and the turning Water into Wine a mere Juggle?—theſe are horrid, fearful, and deſperate ſcruples; yet may they come athwart ſome mens Souls upon the ſuppoſition of this good, and godly Doctrine of Devils; beſides, what ſhall we Proteſtants be able to ſay, to, or againſt that monſtrous Opinion of the Papiſts; The groſſe and carnal preſence of Chriſt's corporeal Body, corporeally in the Euchariſt, the ubiquity of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or Tranſubſtantiation, and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of theſe? And again if a Devil can contract a Witch into the diminutive Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of a Rat, Catt, Hare, Flea or louſe he can doubtleſs too ſominiſy her, that ſhe ſhall be able to enter into any Chamber, Cloſet, or ſecret place, be the doors never ſo well ſhut, as faſt or cloſe, as art can make them; which was one of Chriſt's Miracles: and I ſee not neither, but that Chriſt may indeed ſo minorate his Body, that he may be eaſily comprehended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the narrow compaſs of a Waſer-cake: and if a man by the help of the Devil can be in diverſe and far diſtant places at one time, It is no wonder, ſtrange thing, or miracle at all, that Chriſt's Body be in

It ſteals from Chriſt the honour of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and of his Miracles he wrought to prove himſelf the Son of God; from the Father, the glory of his incommunicable Attributes; and from the Spirit the credit of theſe ſpecial Operations for which we Adore him. And is not this Sacriledge, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge in the higheſt; from the higheſt, and from the Holieſt too? For Blaſphemy, it intimates, that Chriſt had not wit enough, to chuſe an Argument, nor power enough to do a Work for proof of that,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:39302:55"/>which he eſpecially intended to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> His eternal Power and Godhead.

And for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, it teacheth not peradventure the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Saints and Angels, nor of Sun, Moon, Stars, or Hoſt of Heaven, nor of Stocks and Stones, nor of Leeks and Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor of Crocodiles and Serpents, nor of <hi>Crepitus ventris, &amp; Deae cloacinae</hi>— (which were the loweſt Degenerancies of the moſt beſotted Heathens.)

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:39302:60"/>that by a power derived to them from the Devil, upon Compact can do ſtrange things among us now, our Witches (according to the general ſuppoſition) differing from the Scripture-Witches, as much as our Horſes do from that imaginary Horſe in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. Our Witches are ſuppoſed to do ſtrange things above the courſe of nature; the Scripture-Witch can never be prov'd to have ever done any ſuch thing. 2. Ours do by a ſupernatural power: (as 'tis ſaid) The others did all by natural means what ever they did. 3. Ours are ſaid to have power from the Devil by Compact, whereas no Compact with the Devil, nor power from him, can be prov'd of the Scripture-Witch. 4. The Scripture-Witch did what he did in publick, feared not the light at leaſt, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 9.22, 21, 6. where, what ours do, is ſcarce intelligible, as being done in ſecret, and in the dark ſtill. 5. The Scripture-Witch might eaſily be diſcovered and known, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.14. whereas no ſufficient tokens, marks, diagnoſticks have been yet produc't, nor ever will (I'm confident) by which ours may be known, and diſcovered for ſuch, nor will it ever be prov'd, that there are, were, or can be ſuch as the vulgar dream of, except by the deſperate perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of malicious Villains, or the confeſſions
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:39302:61"/>of miſerable, beſotted, and irrational old wretches, or peeviſh dreams of melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Hypocondriacks, which are no way ſufficient to convince any Man, though but of ordinary and common underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Shortly there is nothing in the word or notion <hi>(Mecaſhapha) Exo.</hi> 22.18. nothing in any other Text, nothing in any antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conſequent or coherence, that any Text throughout the Book, nothing in any feat, or work attributed to the <hi>Caſhaphim</hi> in Scripture, that intimates or hinteth Devil, or compact with a Devil, or that needed the Devils aſſiſtance for the effecting of it. This word therefore, or any conjugate thereof cannot, I think, ſignifie in any ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Mans judgment, a perſon in compact with the Devil: for, as for the ſeats that were done, if any ſuch ſeats were indeed done by thoſe Juglers of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in oppoſition to or Emulation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they are three or four times (that is all the times, that any thing is ſaid to be done there) attributed to the <hi>Hartummim</hi> ſtill, not to the <hi>Caſhaphim</hi> at all: whereas <hi>Ex.</hi> 22.18. ſpeaketh only of the <hi>Caſhaphim,</hi> not at all of the <hi>Hartummim;</hi> yet theſe too, did but Juggle as I have ſhewed fully in another place.</p>

               <p>But I muſt add here: Though a Church, the whole Church, to a very few, may thus generally be erronious, even in ſuch a point; yet may it not be ſtraight un-churched, or become preſently an Abdicate, Reprobate, or Anathematized Church, for an Error or two, though groſſe ones: we had ſcarce elſe a viſible Church in the World, for many Hundred years: God giveth more grace: Every error, miſtake, or heterodoxy, though great enough, doth not nullify a Church, if it be not obſtinately, wilfully, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly perſiſted in. If the whole Church ſin through Ignorance, there may be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.13. A Church, a whole Church may be under the Guilt of ſome great Sin, and yet be the Church of God ſtill: Groſs and Hainous Sins, may not be Grounds enough for Separation; and therefore our <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> have no Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyable
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:39302:66"/>Warrant for their <hi>Schiſm,</hi> from the pretended groſs Sins of this Church, and State. Is there? can there be? can they wire-draw any of our National, or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Sins, into greater Horridneſs, than this Sin hath? And yet had God his Church ſtill; nay and even they alſo were of His Church that Embrac'd that horrid Heterodoxy: Nay, they themſelves are Guilty, moſt of them, of this moſt Horrid Heterodoxy; and yet will they reckon themſelves of <hi>God</hi>'s Church. How then, or with what Face, can they Anathematize, or Unchriſten another Society, whom they cannot accuſe of any Crime, ſo horrid as this? Doubtleſs the Sins of this Nation are High and Horrid, peradventure, never more: the Lord of His goodneſs, change our Minds, reform our Extravagancies, and rectify our Converſations, according to the Pattern, and the great Exemplar, the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We had need beg this Heartily, leſt, according to the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of our preſent ſinfull Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our Judgments be Tranſcendent, and of the Superlative Dimenſion. We may well fear this, though we have already, and do now yet ſuffer ſo much; yet may we juſtly ſear more: His Wrath may not be turned away yet: but His Hand may be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:39302:67"/>ſtretched out ſtill; yea, He may Plague us Seven times yea and Seven times more ſtill; yea and likely will: God will be Conquerour one way or other, either in our Converſion, or Confuſion. Can we kick againſt the Pricks? Are we able to contend with <hi>God,</hi> or are we Stronger than <hi>God?</hi> Shall an Earthen Pot contend with a Brazen Mountain? Sure, ſure, it will be bitter, exceeding bitter, in the end; bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer and bitterer, ſtill, till the End; and peradventure without End. Let us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this, by our Complyance with, and Conformity to the Divine Will of <hi>God;</hi> and, the Good Lord grant, that Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and all others, in their ſeveral Places and Stations, may do their parts. There is not, hath not been, cannot be, a more Groſs, Blaſphemous, or Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Villany; nor more Injurious, both to <hi>God</hi> and Man, than this: nor Fornication, nor Intemperance, nor any other of thoſe Raging Sins of this Age. This therefore, eſpecially, over, above, and beyond all elſe, ſhould they joyntly ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. The Magiſtrates are <hi>God</hi>'s Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Deputies, and Vice-gerents, and ſhould they not Act for <hi>God?</hi> for <hi>God</hi> againſt the Devil, not for the Devil, againſt <hi>God?</hi> Sure, Miniſters are <hi>God</hi>'s Ambaſſadors,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:39302:67"/>and ſhould proclaim, publiſh, and declare His Greatneſs, Majeſty, and Power; not Traiterouſly give away theſe Jewels of His Crown, to His Adverſary, Competitor, or Rebellious Vaſſal. All the reſt are <hi>God</hi>'s Leige-Subjects, and Menial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or Souldiers under His Banner; and ſhould they not Fight to uphold His Crown and Dignity? ſhould they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, tamely to yield up His Royal Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, to be uſurp'd by that Villainous Traitor of Hell? Truly, nor Magiſtrate, nor Miniſter, nor People, can do <hi>God</hi> a greater Diſhonour, nor the Devil better Service, than by maintaining this <hi>Doctrine of Devils.</hi> Once, this cannot be deny'd, the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh expreſly againſt it; whoſoever therefore ſpeaketh for it, ſets his Mouth againſt Heaven, againſt <hi>God,</hi> againſt the Holy-Ghoſt: What would we expect more than the Word, the plain, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Word of <hi>God,</hi> for the ſetling us in or againſt a Doctrine? When the Lord hath decided the Controverſy, &amp; ſetled the Queſtion, ſhould men's Moots, groundleſs Opinions, ſmall Arguments, and whilde Winter-Tales, unſettle us?

Or, if they were full, and without any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as to their Deſcription of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> or the Marks of him; then was not <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo well adviſed, to ſend them to theſe obſcure, and ſubordinate Marks, when there were better and clearer?

               <p>THat it is <hi>Paſſion,</hi> or <hi>Prepoſſeſſion,</hi> That engageth the Learned Man, to be ſo earneſt for the <hi>Power of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> ſeemeth clear, to me from the <hi>petty Cavils,</hi> he hath againſt that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Book</hi> called, <hi>The Queſtion of VVitchcraft, Debated; (Debated,</hi> not <hi>Stated;</hi> but with Modeſty enough, if not too much, <hi>Debated</hi>) a <hi>Book,</hi> that contains more <hi>good Reaſon, true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and <hi>right Chriſtianity,</hi> than all thoſe Lumps, and Cart-Loads of Luggage, that hath been Fardled up, by all the Faggeters of <hi>Demonologiſtical VVinter-Tales,</hi> and <hi>Witcheraftical Legendaries;</hi> ſince they firſt begun to foul clean Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. His firſt Attempt is, To prove againſt that Ingenious <hi>Author</hi> that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaph</hi> ſignifies in <hi>Scripture, (Witches, i. e.</hi> ſuch <hi>Perſons,</hi> as acted by a Power derived to them from the Devil, and not <hi>mock-Miraclers, Impoſtors,</hi> or <hi>Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:39302:84"/>becauſe moſt, if not all, <hi>Tranſlae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> (and he reckons up many names) ſo interpret it; but he leaves-out <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> and the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> who being <hi>Natural Jews,</hi> and <hi>Great Scholars</hi> to boot, counterballance all the other <hi>great Names:</hi> Eſpecially, ſince they were Perſons that lived long before this <hi>Doctrine of Devils</hi> was hatch'd; and ſo more likely, to be more <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbyaſſed Interpreters,</hi> than thoſe who lived, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the World was bewitched with that <hi>monstruous Opinion. Joſephus,</hi> without doubt, was as <hi>Antient,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his <hi>Interpreters;</hi> nay, they meer <hi>Youngsters,</hi> in reſpect of him, all. And for the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> they were at leaſt 350. Years Elder than his <hi>Eldest Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> who yet by his own <hi>Confeſſion, pag.</hi> 180. interpret <hi>Caſaph</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e. Veneficus.</hi> Beſides, what-ever his <hi>Interpreters</hi> were, they had but the word, <hi>Caſaph,</hi> the <hi>Etymon,</hi> and the uſe of that Word, or the Coherence of the <hi>Text,</hi> To guide them into the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi> of it: And all theſe have we now, as well as they; 1. For the Word, we may ſay it boldly, It doth not in, of, or by it ſelf, ſignifie a <hi>Witch, i. e.</hi> One that is in Compact with the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:39302:84"/>Devil; for, neither is Compact, nor Devil included in the <hi>Notion</hi> of it. But only, a Covering, Changing, or Altering the outward Face, or Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of things, which may be done many wayes, without the Intervention of Devils; Yea, cannot be done by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Aſſiſtance from them. 2. For the uſe of the word, <hi>Joſephus,</hi> and the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint,</hi> interpreting it <hi>Poyſoner;</hi> it is more than probable, that this was the moſt uſual <hi>Senſe</hi> of it. 3. For the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of the <hi>Text,</hi> it is never any where uſed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> where the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>Context,</hi> doth not plainly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it, to <hi>Impoſtor, Spiritual Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, Jugler,</hi> or <hi>Deceiver,</hi> rather than to <hi>Witch,</hi> in the <hi>Demonologiſt's Senſe,</hi> all the <hi>Scripture</hi> over; as is plain, if any man, do but unbyaſſedly conſider the ſeveral places, where the word is uſed, as I have intimated afore. Yea, when the Learned man comes to give the Words of the <hi>Interpreters,</hi> they are but theſe, <hi>Magus, Maleficus,</hi> (or <hi>Veneficus,</hi> for that's the Word he proceeds on, in his <hi>Deſcant</hi>) and <hi>Praeſtigiator,</hi> &amp;c. which are ſo far from intimating his <hi>Witches,</hi> as <hi>Latro,</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> is from ſignifying a <hi>Regicide;</hi> or (to uſe his own Terms)
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:39302:85"/>as far as <hi>Lapis</hi> is from ſignifying a <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mice;</hi> or <hi>Panis,</hi> a <hi>Wafer-Cake.</hi> The Words, not any of them, in any ſort, intimating the Thing they are produc'd for.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Magus,</hi> is properly, a great <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt,</hi> or a Perſon well ſkil'd in the Courſes and Operations of <hi>Nature:</hi> improperly, and by Abuſe, a Fellow that pretending to do great things, (in cheat) <hi>Supernaturally,</hi> with much <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice,</hi> and <hi>Cunning,</hi> makes uſe only of ſome <hi>Natural Operations,</hi> that be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unuſual, and not ordinarily known, to deceive the Simple. 2. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſicus</hi> is a <hi>Poyſoner,</hi> and cannot well be hal'd in, to ſignifie any thing elſe, at leaſt not one, that by a power derived from the Devil, can, or doth do, ſtrange things; No more than <hi>Beneficus,</hi> or <hi>Salvificus</hi> can ſignifie a <hi>Perſon,</hi> that by Influence from an <hi>Angel,</hi> can work <hi>Miracles.</hi> It is true, becauſe ſome of theſe Villains, with ſo much Cunning, and Artifice, exerciſed this their Wickedneſs, That ordinarily it was not conceived, how they could effect their Miſchiefs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Intervention of ſome <hi>Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Aſſiſtance. Veneficus,</hi> might abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, be uſurped for one that dealt with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:39302:85"/>
                  <hi>Evil Spirits.</hi> But as there, nor are now, nor ever were, any ſuch Perſons: So, nor did, doth, nor can that <hi>Word,</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſignifie any ſuch thing; and therefore the <hi>Poets,</hi> themſelves, the firſt Finders, Makers, and Fathers of <hi>Witches, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Lucan, Tibullsu, Homer,</hi> &amp;c. bring them in ſtill as gathering, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and compounding, <hi>Poyſonous Herbs;</hi> and ſuch <hi>deleterious ſtuffe;</hi> by which they acted their ſtrangeſt, and moſt ſtupend <hi>Miſchiefs.</hi> And becauſe, vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly, it was not known, how their ſtrange Effects were produced, It was thought <hi>generally;</hi> eſpecially by the <hi>Rabble,</hi> and poſſibly by ſome others who were look't upon, by themſelves, and others too, as Wiſe-men, (as the Effects wrought now by the <hi>Magnetick Powder,</hi> and the <hi>Weapon-Salve,</hi> are by ſome, who reckon themſelves no mean <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oliſts</hi>) that they acted altogether, by the Aſſiſtance of ſome <hi>Daemons,</hi> when they wrought any unuſual <hi>Feats.</hi> But <hi>Poyſoner</hi> is the ſignification of the word <hi>Veneficus;</hi> and the Practiſe of thoſe that were ſo called, was <hi>Poyſoning;</hi> as I could inſtance in all the fore-named <hi>Poets,</hi> and others, beſides theſe: But I will here on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make uſe of <hi>Lucan,</hi> as he is Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:39302:86"/>into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that it may the better be underſtood by the vulgar. <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> comes to that notorious <hi>Cheat</hi> or <hi>Witch, Erichtho,</hi> to underſtand the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Iſſue of the <hi>Pharſalian Battail;</hi> which ſhe (in ſome ſort) cheatingly undertakes to diſcover; and having found a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs fit for the purpoſe, (you muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Poets,</hi> to fancy what Fooleries they pleaſe, eſpecially when they ſpeak of <hi>Witches</hi>) ſhe falls to her <hi>Witchcraft;</hi> but how?

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:39302:91"/>Eyes, and Ingenies, as any other men, cannot but believe that it ſhineth: And truly it was as evident, as that the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhines at <hi>Noon-day,</hi> That there were <hi>Witches,</hi> and <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> (that enabled thoſe <hi>Witches)</hi> if it be true what the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monologers</hi> ſay of <hi>Witches;</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi> And therefore either the <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> did not, yea could not, poſſibly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe <hi>Witchcraft</hi> (which is abſolutely falſe); or elſe <hi>Demonologers</hi> invent, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, and obtrude, many <hi>groſs, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, monſtrous,</hi> and <hi>incredible Lies,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People, (which is undoubtedly a <hi>Truth</hi>). The <hi>Argument</hi> drawn from the <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Sadduces</hi> is unanſwerable, by all the <hi>Demonologers</hi> in <hi>Christendome,</hi> (and I think there are very few without the Compaſs of that <hi>Circle)</hi> if they will ſtand ingenuouſly to their own <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> to their <hi>Principles, Comments,</hi> or <hi>Interpretations;</hi> and not uſe <hi>Witchcraft</hi> indeed, that is, <hi>Tergiverſations, Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges,</hi> and <hi>Cheating Evaſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. To that which is ſaid by the <hi>Deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That the Scripture-Witches acted openly, our Suppoſed-Witches but in the dark.</hi> It is remooted, indeed; There was a <hi>Law</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> by which <hi>Witches,</hi> i. e. <hi>Perſons that acted by the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:39302:91"/>Devil, were to be puniſhed with Death. Anſw.</hi> But this reſts yet to be proved. 2. <hi>That that Law was repeated more than once,</hi> that is often. <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is not at all made to appear, nor can it appear; The <hi>Law</hi> meant, no doubt, is that, <hi>Ex.</hi> 22.18. but much miſtaken in the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation;</hi> and never any where elſe at all repeated, that I can find. There is indeed, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.27. another <hi>Law for the putting to death of the</hi> Shoel.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:39302:92"/>be proved, this, of many; nay nor that ſo much as one man ever acted, or was deſtroyed among the <hi>Jews,</hi> for acting by a Power derived from the <hi>Devil</hi> upon Compact. What-ever beſotted <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and <hi>Rabbinistical</hi> men prate, I know not, I paſs not, I care not; There is no <hi>Text</hi> for it. 4. <hi>They acted this Villainy cloſely then, as now,</hi> as 'tis ſaid of ſome of them. <hi>An.</hi> 1.

The <hi>Argument,</hi> That the Opinion of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> is <hi>Dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to God</hi>'s <hi>Honour; as ſetting up many</hi> Gods <hi>is ſlubber'd over, with that weak, ſilly, if not blaſphemous Evaſion,</hi> viz. <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Permiſſion in reſpect of Devils;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:39302:92"/>and the Paſſage in</hi> Job <hi>brought in, to Countenance it.</hi> But to reply to this, in ſhort; The <hi>Devil,</hi> with all his <hi>Devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> though <hi>God</hi> give him Rope enough, as much as he can wiſh, cannot poſſibly do thoſe <hi>Works,</hi> which he <hi>Attributes</hi> to him, as being Acts properly belonging to <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>God;</hi> and for the <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that he brings, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers were <hi>Incarnate Devils;</hi> The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baeans,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldaans,</hi> were men Poſſeſſed with <hi>Devils,</hi> or ſo many <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> in the ſhape of men; it is doubtleſs ſo groſs a Wildneſs, that the moſt blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Obedient <hi>Papists,</hi> or <hi>Paynims,</hi> beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly credulous, would be much puzled to give any <hi>Credit</hi> to it.

               <p>The laſt <hi>Attempt</hi> againſt the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Ingenuous <hi>Debater,</hi> is, A joyning with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (whoſe <hi>Intereſt</hi> is much concern'd, and moſt of their <hi>Superſtitions</hi> upheld, by this <hi>Doctrine of Devils,)</hi> to <hi>mutilate,</hi> and <hi>circumciſe</hi> that <hi>Antient Council</hi> of <hi>Ancyra;</hi> and not that <hi>Council</hi> only, but all other <hi>Councils</hi> elſe, beſides, according to his Reaſonings: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>In theſe Collections, (that is of the Councils in general) different Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of different Times, and Authors, are patch'd up together; and that this is ſure enough, is acknowledged by all men.</hi> But if it be thus, What Eſteem or Credit is there to be yielded, by any man, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe <hi>Collections,</hi> or <hi>Councils,</hi> now extant? Men, at leaſt, may cut off, thus, what <hi>Collops</hi> they will, at any time, when any things in thoſe <hi>Councils</hi> make againſt their purpoſe. We muſt of neceſſity have
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:39302:94"/>a new general <hi>Council,</hi> meerly to make up an <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> that we may know, what <hi>Canons, Paragraphs,</hi> or <hi>Clauſes</hi> of <hi>Canons,</hi> are <hi>Genuine,</hi> and what <hi>Spurious. Delrio,</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> were, I confeſs, Learned men; and our Reverend <hi>Doctor,</hi> as Learned; yea, I think more Learned than either, or both of them: And yet, ſince all <hi>Three</hi> but <hi>Demonologiſts,</hi> they muſt (unleſs they give better <hi>Reaſons</hi> for their <hi>Defalcations</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> than yet they have) pardon me, if I diſſent from them. It is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, what this Learned man ſayes himſelf, in anſwer unto <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> who pretended, That the Writings of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> were falſifyed, and interpolated by the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If we take this Liberty</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we ſhall not know, what to ſay of any man, what he maintained, or believed, by his Writings; what</hi> Plato, <hi>what</hi> Ariſtotle, <hi>what any</hi> Fathers, <hi>or</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, <hi>&amp;c. if it will ſerve, to ſay, Theſe Writings are Spurious, Adulterated, and Corrupted.</hi> Cred. <hi>and</hi> Incred. <hi>in things Civil.</hi> pag. 108. Apply this to the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> and what can any man know of any <hi>Canons</hi> made by, or in them? Beſides, I would willingly know (if this paſſage of the <hi>Ancyran Council</hi> be a <hi>Spurious
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:39302:94"/>Interpolation,</hi> or an <hi>Adulterous Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)</hi> Who were, who poſſibly could be the <hi>Authors</hi> of this <hi>Knavery?</hi> Not the <hi>Papiſts</hi> without doubt, either by their own <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Connivance;</hi> (for this <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polated Paſſage,</hi> as 'tis called, makes againſt their <hi>Superstitiom</hi> much); and if not by them, then was it before any <hi>Cheats</hi> of theirs in this kind were ever ventred on: And conſequently the <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage</hi> muſt need be very <hi>antient;</hi> and ſo ought to be reverenced for its great <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> as being, probably, as <hi>antient,</hi> as that very <hi>Council,</hi> or rather (which is more probable) a <hi>genuine Canon</hi> of it. Not that I think, That every thing which we find faggetted up together, by the <hi>Collectors</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> under that <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy,</hi> (which almoſt over-whelmed the whole <hi>Chriſtian World)</hi> muſt preſently be received as <hi>Canonical.</hi> No, no: Thus might we ſwallow the greateſt <hi>Gobbets</hi> of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>fatteſt</hi> and <hi>ſweeteſt Viands</hi> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> propoſeth. But, That we well weigh, conſider, and examine all things, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerving the <hi>occaſions,</hi> why; the <hi>times,</hi> when; and by whom; the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> were called.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:39302:95"/>1. To have his <hi>Vagary.</hi> 2. In that he undervalueth, or rather traduceth, the <hi>Debater,</hi> for a ſmall <hi>Linguiſt,</hi> and a ſmaller <hi>Hiſtorian;</hi> and yet he ſheweth as much ſkill in the <hi>Languages,</hi> as was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for his purpoſe; and as much <hi>Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Hiſtory,</hi> as poſſibly could be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, upon the occaſion. 3. Had he a mind to it, or the occaſion required it, he could, I doubt not, have ſhown much more: but he was not for <hi>extravagant Rambles,</hi> as moſt <hi>Criticks</hi> are; Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloriouſly to <hi>oſtentate</hi> their <hi>great Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>ſubtile Conjectures,</hi> upon ſmall, or no occaſions. 4.

               <p>SInce the ſiniſhing of that above, I have with much ado, gotten another <hi>Book,</hi> (Cited in the Former) called, <hi>Credulity, and Incredulity in Naturals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as the <hi>Former</hi> was, <hi>In Spirituals, in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Things:</hi> wherein the Learned <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> proſecutes the Buſineſs of <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,</hi> directly, and at large; <hi>tanquam pro focis, &amp; aris;</hi> in which, indeed, I find much <hi>Reading,</hi> much <hi>Learning,</hi>

The <hi>Proofs</hi> for the <hi>Author</hi>'s <hi>Opinion</hi> are many <hi>Stories,</hi> and ſome few <hi>Reaſons,</hi> but no <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture;</hi> at leaſt, none that he dares truſt unto. It were endleſs to go over all, and needleſs too; ſince I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy anſwered the <hi>chief Subſtantial,</hi> and <hi>Vital Parts</hi> of all his <hi>Reaſons, Tales,</hi> and <hi>Texts.</hi> And yet, ſince the <hi>Author</hi> is a Perſon whom I juſtly honour, for many Excellent <hi>Endowments;</hi> as his <hi>great Learning, Piety, Loyalty,</hi> and <hi>Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> I cannot chuſe (leſt I ſhould ſeem to ſlight him) but ſay ſomething to ſome of his <hi>Propoſals.</hi> The firſt <hi>Story</hi> he brings for the <hi>Proof</hi> of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> or <hi>Supernatural Operations</hi> by <hi>Devils,</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of <hi>Boden. pag.</hi> 32, 33. Anſw. 1. <hi>Boden,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> have ſhewed, is a <hi>Suſpitious Author,</hi> as to this buſineſs; and our Learned man gives ground enough, for the <hi>conſirmation</hi> of this <hi>Suſpition, pag.</hi> 169, &amp;c. 2. Men of <hi>Bodin</hi>'s <hi>Religion,</hi> have not been very dainty, in abſtaining from ſuch <hi>Witchcraft</hi> as this is, <hi>viz.</hi> When they could not confute their <hi>Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts</hi> alive, to blaze abroad, That at their <hi>Death,</hi> or a little before, they <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted, forſooth.</hi> Thus many <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious,</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:39302:97"/>and <hi>Invincible Proteſtants,</hi> that oppoſed their <hi>Superstition</hi> till <hi>Death,</hi> have been ſcandaled, <hi>That at, in, or a little before Death, they Apoſtitated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Popery.</hi> They of the ſame <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> will not be backward, To uſe the ſame <hi>Artifices,</hi> for the ſame <hi>Ends,</hi> &amp;c. 3. The <hi>Phyſitian</hi> might himſelf (ſeeing <hi>Bodin</hi> ſo much <hi>bewitch't</hi> with that <hi>wild conceit</hi> of <hi>Witchcraft</hi>) tell him this <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in a Jeer, to make him Ridiculous. Witty <hi>Knaves</hi> have uſed ſuch kind of <hi>waggeries.</hi> Did not <hi>John Pipin</hi> put ſuch a <hi>trick</hi> upon his Friend, <hi>Anthony Mizal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and many other Learned men of <hi>France? Credul. and Incredul. in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</hi> pag. 175 But 4. I ſay, beſides all this, if <hi>Spiraculum cellae</hi> may be taken for the <hi>Breathing</hi> or <hi>puffing</hi> up of a <hi>Blast</hi> of <hi>Wind</hi> from the bottom of the <hi>Cellar,</hi> (as, for ought I know, it may, <hi>I</hi> have not <hi>Bodins</hi> Book) then this ſtory is but meer Wind. But <hi>I</hi> muſt take the <hi>Story</hi> at the worſt, at the ſecond, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure at the third or fourth hand, as it is framed for the buſineſs: The <hi>Relation</hi> ſpeakes of Digging and Breaking of the <hi>Earth</hi> in a <hi>Fault,</hi> or <hi>Cellar,</hi> where the Pretended <hi>Hobgoblins</hi> ſeemed to be moſt frequent, and troubleſome, (it is called,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:39302:97"/>
                  <hi>Haunting</hi>). Upon the Digging of the <hi>Earth,</hi> there was a kind of <hi>Whirl-VVind,</hi> which aſcending up from the bottom of the <hi>Cellar,</hi> put out the <hi>Candles,</hi> battered down part of a <hi>Neighbouring Houſe,</hi> the <hi>Chimney,</hi> and <hi>Porch</hi> of the ſame <hi>Houſe;</hi> and (which is moſt notoriouſly conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as a part of a <hi>Supernatural Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by a <hi>Devil</hi>) brake a <hi>Stone-Pitcher,</hi> and a <hi>VVater-Pot,</hi> which a Woman was then carrying. This is the Sum of the <hi>Story,</hi> except a few <hi>Flowriſhes</hi> to ſet out the <hi>Accident,</hi> as a thing miraculous, if poſſible. But what need men go to a <hi>Devil,</hi> for the anſwering of all this? <hi>I</hi> will not ſay, There is <hi>Contradiction</hi> in the <hi>Story;</hi> but it ſeems to claſh with it ſelf: when the Woman carryed her <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Pot,</hi> through the <hi>Streets,</hi> 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, 'twas <hi>Day-light;</hi> but yet it ſeems to be <hi>Night,</hi> when they were forc'd to uſe <hi>Candle-light,</hi> in their Digging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> paſs this, and ſay; <hi>Wind,</hi> when pent up in ſome cloſe <hi>Vault, Hole, Cave,</hi> or <hi>Cavern,</hi> under a <hi>Cellar,</hi> may, nay muſt, make, ordinarily, ſome great noyſe, and cauſe Shaking (making the <hi>Candles</hi> ſometimes give a <hi>Tremulous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Devil</hi> could not get up out of the <hi>bottom</hi> of the <hi>Cellar,</hi> until the ground was broken for him, to let him out. Oh pitiful poor impotent Goblin! Had it been one of thoſe <hi>Omnipotent Devils,</hi> (our <hi>Demonologiſts</hi> dream of) it might have gotten out ſooner, no doubt, if it would, before the Digging; or after the Digging might have ſtaid there ſtill, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Digging: And yet the Digging it was, it ſeems, that let the Devil looſe, from that <hi>Priſon,</hi> where he was (whether he would or no) irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diably confin'd, and damn'd; but that a bold <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> upon the <hi>confidence</hi> he had of a <hi>cheating Gypſie,</hi> ventered to digg there.

               </p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Argument</hi> is, <hi>Conſenſus gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris humani,</hi> or <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Conſent of Mankind</hi> (a large Word) for his <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:39302:99"/>This is the great and grand <hi>Topick</hi> of the <hi>Demonologists.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, in another place, anſwered more than all that, that is here ſaid, amounts unto; by ſhewing, firſt, That there never was for ſome <hi>Thouſand</hi> of <hi>Years</hi> any ſuch <hi>Conceit,</hi> muchleſs <hi>general Conſent of man-kind,</hi> nor ever ſince, for <hi>Witchcraft;</hi> nor, if there had been, was it a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Argument</hi> to prove the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Opinion,</hi> by inſtancing in a Foppery, that hath as generally been received (and more) as this <hi>Opinion</hi> of <hi>Witchcraft;</hi> and yet no <hi>Reality,</hi> or <hi>Truth,</hi> in the <hi>Figment</hi> at all. <hi>I</hi> ſhall add another, That every man may be doubly provided, for the baffling of this <hi>Objection,</hi> when ever they meet with it; An <hi>inſtance</hi> it is, of a thing (if any ſuch thing there be, or were) that came under the <hi>Dijudication</hi> of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and yet nothing but <hi>Fiction,</hi> and <hi>Cheat</hi> in it, though generally believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as <hi>de ſide: I</hi> mean the <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Wonders</hi> that are, &amp; have been, reported, to have been done, at the <hi>Tombs, Dormito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sepulchers;</hi> or before the <hi>Shrines, Images,</hi> and <hi>Pictures</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs;</hi> or by their Reliques, as by the <hi>Arm, Legg, Foot, Head, Hand, ſmall Finger,</hi> or <hi>little Toe,</hi> &amp;c. by the <hi>Nails, Hair,</hi> and

What <hi>Volumes?</hi> what <hi>Cart-loads?</hi> what <hi>Dung-hills</hi> of <hi>Legends,</hi> to this purpoſe, and all for many hundred Years believed, all <hi>Christendome</hi> over, which then (when theſe <hi>Miracles</hi> came in <hi>Vogue</hi>) was the greateſt and beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited <hi>part</hi> of the then known <hi>World;</hi> the moſt part of <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> reſounded with them, (and now yet too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in <hi>America</hi>)?

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:39302:100"/>Rotten Rags,</hi> and <hi>Old Shoos,</hi> ſhould work ſuch <hi>Miracles;</hi> when he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver honoured the <hi>Perſons,</hi> while alive, with any ſuch <hi>Miraculous Power:</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſince theſe <hi>pretended Miracles,</hi> did in their very <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>tendency,</hi> tend directly to the bringing in of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, Idolatry,</hi> and the ſhameful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing of the <hi>Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> wrought by the great <hi>God,</hi> and His Bleſſed Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as the very <hi>Pretence</hi> actually did. Now, that I may extend the <hi>Credulity</hi> of this Dream, to as vaſt <hi>Limits,</hi> as any <hi>Demonologer</hi> can extend the <hi>conceit</hi> of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> I add, That all this <hi>infatuated conceit</hi> concerning ſuch <hi>Miracles,</hi> was but a meer <hi>Relickt,</hi> or <hi>Apiſh-imitation</hi> of <hi>Pagan Dreams,</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh Adorations,</hi> in reſpect to their <hi>antient Heroes, demi-Gods,</hi> or <hi>Demons</hi> Did they not all of them, as far as <hi>Paganiſm</hi> extended, (and that was far enough) fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and believe <hi>Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Wonders,</hi> to have been done by thoſe whom they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Heroick</hi> Perſons, &amp; had deify'd after <hi>Death,</hi> for their <hi>Gallantries, Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> &amp; <hi>Glorious Acts,</hi> done by them when alive? Hence it is, That we hear of ſuch ſtrange <hi>Things</hi> done by <hi>Jupiter, Apollo, Mars, Juno, Pallas, Hercules, Bacchus,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:39302:101"/>Caſtor, Pollux,</hi> yea <hi>Romulus,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius.</hi> In other Countries they had other <hi>Names, Termes,</hi> and <hi>Titles,</hi> for their <hi>Devil-Gods;</hi> but the ſame <hi>Superstition,</hi> and <hi>beſotted Credulity</hi> of believing <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> done by them, after their <hi>depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> hence, to their own places. And this, As at other places, often; So, at their <hi>Shrines,</hi> before their <hi>Images,</hi> or <hi>Pictures,</hi> in their <hi>Temples,</hi> moſt frequently, where the <hi>Priests</hi> reſided; who were (indeed) the <hi>Perſons,</hi> that did the <hi>Feats,</hi> and had Face and Knavery enough, to venter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Juggle</hi> of a <hi>Miracle,</hi> That they might continue to receive the <hi>Rich Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,</hi> and <hi>Oblations,</hi> which made up <hi>Treaſuries</hi> ſo hugely vaſt, as is almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, as appears by thoſe huge <hi>Maſſes</hi> of <hi>Wealth,</hi> belonging to <hi>Jupiter Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's,</hi> and <hi>Apollo's Temple</hi> at <hi>Delphos.</hi> Who was the <hi>Author,</hi> or firſt <hi>Inventor</hi> of thoſe Prodigious <hi>Romances,</hi> (but moſt <hi>Monstrous Fictions</hi>) it matters not much; but when once ſuch wild <hi>Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> were publiſhed abroad, concerning one of their <hi>Idols,</hi> in one place; That he, or it, had done ſuch and ſuch <hi>Feats,</hi> there was a general Entertainment, and Invention of the like <hi>monſtrous Fables,</hi> throughout the <hi>Pagan</hi> World.
